It’s 150 mL, which is 50 mL more than the Snail Mucin Essence and the AHA Power Liquid and I’m guessing it’s about 4-5 inches tall? In my opinion, the spray nozzle is really convenient so you don’t need to use a cotton pad every time you use a toner (it’s optional). When I used it for the first time, it did irritate my skin a tiny bit BUT EVERYONE’S SKIN IS DIFFERENT, so it may have a different effect on other people. Try it for yourself! What I like about it is that every time when you spray it, a generous amount of product comes out so 3-4 sprays is okay. After spraying, I pat it in. Most sources say you can use daily, but I’m starting 3 days a week and building up to daily use to see how my skin reacts.
I’m pretty sure that this toner will be great for people who are trying to exfoliate to remove dead skin cells; however since it has such a low concentration it will take longer to see results. Thank you for the purchase! I hope this review helped!"

My skin is on the oily side but it is very sensitive to oily skin products. They will dry out my skin , cause irritation and then make me super oily .

I don't have oily skin but did not feel like my skin was drying out from it. Due to my skin type, I did start to get a patch of redness & irritation from using it daily because of the acid ingredients, which has happened with other AHA/BHA products. So, I knew this product was working. I just cut back to using it 2 times a week to help with exfoliation. I like the fine mist spray, but I usually spray 2 pumps on my hand and pat onto my face. Then, I layer a different hydrating toner over this one. I prefer applying with my hands instead of a cotton pad/ball b/c I get more of the toner on my face and don't waste the toner trying to soak the cotton ball.

I like how this brand has a medical approach to skincare and that the products tend to be fragrance-free & dye-free, which can irritate skin."

Not rlly much to say about this product, if your using retinal don’t use it the same night you use the toner since it’s a AHA/BHA product.
It didn’t do WONDERS but didn’t do anything bad.

Overall it’s a neutral product, it’s soft, doesn't irritate, didn’t break me out and got rid of some texture. I use it every other night since I do use retinol, been using for 2 months now.

Then again some products work good for some and bad for others.
I do have sensitive, acne prone, dry skin and it hasn’t done anything bad to my skin so there’s that."

Not to mention i have fairly sensitive skin. I’ve tried countless face washes, toners, moisturizers, spot creams and NOTHING was working. i even changed my curology prescription. i’ve used the pimple patches from this brand and absolutely love them. When i had ordered them they came with a sample spot treatment. i gave it a try and it was one of the first spot treatments EVER that seemed to work almost overnight. that’s what led me to trying this toner.

It’s lightweight (kinda just feels like water) and comes in a spray bottle which is amazing for easy application. i do a few sprays on my face and lightly rub it in w my fingertips to make sure my face is evenly coated and then let it air dry. and let me tell you this is by far my FAV toner i’ve ever used and i’ve only used it for abt a month or two. There’s no excessive stinging or drying out my skin and it helped with redness and inflammation just after 1 use. My cystic acne has started to clear up AMAZINGLY. i mostly only have slight hyperpigmentation (which it’s also helped with) from where pimples used to be but no current massive, active pimples on my face. if you’re thinking of trying this i would 100% recommend giving it a go. i just started using a few other products from this brand as well and so far so good :)"

Used to love it. I've gone through some hormonal changes and my skin has become more acne prone. I had to go through the ingredient lists of my products with a fine-tooth comb, and this product contains lauric acid which is actually highly comedogenic- same rating as coconut oil. I switched to the CeraVe salicylic acid cleanser without that ingredient for about one month, and noticed far less texture on my skin. I think this product has some great ingredients and could work for some skin types, but the lauric acid may aggravate breakouts if you are prone to that.

This is AMAZING. Absolutely gentle enough to use every day. For the first week or so my skin was a little drier and tighter, but now it's perfect. My acne is down and I didn't have my normal period pimples.
Also the bottle is made to dispense the perfect amount. A pea size is perfect and that's what the bottle puts out. No over dispensing product. And only needing such a small amount means this will last a while.
The salicylic acid is perfectly formulated to help control acne and not be over drying and it will be my daily cleanser for as long as they make it!"

This product has made a significant difference in my skincare regimen as an individual with combo skin that is also both sensitive and eczema prone. Before trying this product, I always noticed that by the time I would sign off of work at 5pm, my skin would normally feel tight and dry with my current routine and I could feel every blink or facial movement on the surface of my skin. After incorporating this serum, I’ve noticed that I don’t get that dry, tightened, sensitive feeling at the end of the day. It does leave a slightly tacky feeling once dry, but to me it is not distracting.

If you are an individual that wears SUNSCREEN regularly: from what I’ve noticed, it doesn’t work particularly well with sunscreens that are mineral based and have at least 20% of zinc and/or titanium oxide. Your skin may likely still feel a little dry at the end of the day. However with chemical sunscreen, this hasn’t been an issue for me.

Overall, I’ll be purchasing this again."

This does its job fantastically-- it hydrates without being too much. Personally I have combination but leaning more dry, sensitive, acne prone skin (the whole shebang) and so far I absolutely love this essence for giving me extra hydration in my skincare routine. I checked the ingredients beforehand in a pore-clogging ingredient checker and it came back clear; after using I'm noticing no issues with breakouts.

It's a good essence. There's no scent and no weird residue left on the skin. If you're oily you might not need this but if you're dry it certainly won't hurt to use this in your routine for some extra hydration, especially in drier climates or during the winter.

The only drawback is that if you use this with a lot of other products in a lengthy skincare routine, these individual costs add up pretty quick, but there's actually quite a bit of product in this that should last you months even with twice daily use. I use the snail mucin essence from the same brand and I still haven't run out of it from twice daily use for four months-- I'm not even halfway through that one, even."

Also, even though I don't have blackheads now, I have lots of white stuff (I think they're called whiteheads) in my nose pores now :( and they are literally the same size as my blackheads were. The worst thing is the white stuff builds up over time so if you don't squeeze them for a long time they will easily squish out when you pinch that area. But if you squeeze them all out (which really looks like worms crawling out of your nose, truly a sight to behold) then the pores will look like someone took a needle and poked your nose or something.

On some good advice, I stopped using apricot scrub and other physical exfoliators and tried this out. I still remember the first time I used it, being amazed at how effective it was compared to the nose-strips I had been using the week prior. I didn't even realize my pores were all enlarged until they shrank after using this a couple times a week. Three years later, I haven't really needed to try other chemical exfoliants because this was so effective; my blackheads are maybe 1/10th of what they used to be.

I'm single and dating, and I've often been told I have ""perfect"" skin, something I've never really received before.

For context: I use this after washing my face in the shower with a light cleanser, applying this immediately thereafter and following up with a moisturizer a few minutes after it dries. I do this 1-2 times a week as a preventative. Otherwise, I use a moisturizer daily (often with low SPF) and a witch hazel toner that I use to ""freshen"" myself on oily days or before re-applying SPF. I avoid fragrances, generally, outside of beard oil/wax. And that's it."

I started using once every other day and after seeing no peeling I upped it to 2 days on 1 day off. I am aware some AHA’s and BHA’s will cause peeling and that’s its way of shedding the old skin however, other AHA’s went way beyond that and I was not seeing results of all the peeling after 2 months. Now using every nite I still see no peeling of my skin. I have noticed a great improvement in my skins dullness and fine lines. I’ve been using for about 2 1/2 months now and it has changed my skin for the better."

I wouldn’t exactly call them blackheads, it would be more accurate to say I have a lot of dried up sebum that clogs the pores and if I don’t remove it then I get blackheads. Many of the products I’ve used have worked, but in turn caused a lot of damage to my skin barrier. After years of neglecting my skin due to depression my pores became very large and clog up within a few days if I don’t stay on top of things. This product has been a game changer. I find that it performs just as well as the Paula’s Choice Liquid Exfoliant, and at a portion of the price. I did find the product was not as drying as the Paula’s Choice either, but this product does feel a bit oily. If you use too much you’ll notice your skin feels a bit slick, so use sparingly, and really a little goes a long way. I have noticed not only does this shrink my pores, and diminish blackheads, but it also helps with extractions. I apply this product, allow it to sit for 15-20 minutes, then go in with my extraction tool and let me tell you…the amount of junk that comes out of my pores is insane! I’ve been able to remove some of the more difficult sebum plugs from my nose with little to no effort after using this product, and I’m referring to plugs that I haven’t been able to remove for months. Some of the pores that have been clogged I would try with tools, cleansers, exfoliants, and even my fingers but I would only damage the skin trying to remove them, and yet THIS👏🏻 PRODUCT 👏🏻 removed those stubborn little bastards effortlessly. I used my tool after applying this and the sebum plugs just glide right out in one piece. I had some really large ones in the crease of my nostrils come out that unbeknownst to me were so bad they looked similar to a grain of rice when I removed them. I had no idea how much junk was hiding deep inside my pores! This is powerful stuff! I’d like to note however, that I have pretty oily, resilient skin, and it takes a really strong product to cause damage to my skin, so where I haven’t noticed much drying or redness I do think that people with sensitive skin should use caution with this product and invest in a barrier protection cream to use in conjunction. There were a few times I over exfoliated with my spin brush and noticed some burning/redness on the sensitive parts so if you’re a person who reacts to stronger products you’re going to want something to combat that effect on your skin. But if you have normal to oily skin, and struggle with blackheads, whiteheads, sebum filaments, clogged pores and the like this is the product for you! I still have almost a full bottle of the Paula’s Choice and every single time I find myself reaching for this instead. I find it works better, and because of the price I don’t feel that I need to ration so carefully. I can just use what I feel I need to use without worrying what the dollar value of the amount of product I just applied was. It’s a nice big bottle that lasts forever, and the squirt cap seems to portion out the product perfectly! I can’t say enough about this product! I am so glad I gave it a try!"

I dont love the price increase though. Everytime ive bought this its $14.50, now up to $20 (with a list price of $25.00). I know inflation is an issue right now but this seems excessive.

I think its worth a try but if you dont find it to be 100% amazing then i think this new increased price puts you in the range of looking at broader line of products that offer more benefits."

I have oily skin, especially around my T-zone, and used Dapsone gel to help prevent acne (which was recommended by my dermatologist). The product did not interfere with any of my other acne products. This is definitely shiny and will leave you looking like a glazed donut, so it's not a morning routine product, unless you're applying it before your makeup and would like a dewy look. Let it fully dry before you start applying other products. Not sure why it's gotten more expensive over the last year, but I'd still consider it a good product."

I have used a few CosRx products now and they have been just bla, I don’t understand the hype. I feel like the people that like CosRx haven’t used good/ decent skincare before. (No offense) Many drugstore products yield better results.
One real gripe is the spray nozzle… it sprays so much out and in 2inch circumference circle. You have to spray about three times to get your whole face and then move it around. It feels like an assault on your face I spray, not enjoyable. Forget about a refreshing spray over makeup during the day, it would ruin your whole face."

I do also love Beauty of Joseon ginseng toner/essence, or Belif milky toner. However, this one does help with redness and isn't overloaded with ingredients. I find though that it isn't quite as hydrating as my other toners but it gives me a nice glow.

In fact, the more I use it, the more I like it. It goes very well with my snail mucin. It also goes well with BOJ ginseng essence/toner if I want to double up, and then some BOJ ginseng/snail mucin. These combinations really knock out the rosacea redness and give me a nice glow of healthy skin.

A tip: if you want to spray this on your face but not your eyes, put some old reading glasses on and spray away - the glasses will keep it out of your eyes and then you just wash or wipe off the glasses. I have a cheap pair of reading glasses that I only use for this - works great! No more product in eyes!

I ordered this after watching a podcast by one of the skin care 'influencers' - I do believe this one was either a derm or a skincare specialist talking up centella asiatica products as good for rosacea, which I do have some rosacea-prone redness on my cheeks from Type 1 rosacea.

Centella asiatica is great for inflammation and redness and perhaps hydration too.

If I continue to like it as much as I am finding over the last week or so, I'm ordering more when this is halfway done!"

There are mixed thoughts on the main ingredient (Asiatica leaf water) being beneficial without other ingredients: asiatic acid, madecassic acid, asiaticoside, and madecassoside.
Possibly those are all included in this product as part of the Asiatica leaf water and not listed, although they are listed in other COSRX products.
I did notice my skin seems smoother and occasional acne I get is less red but there are always multi factors with skin changes.

I’d probably go for their other Asiatica toner next to see if the added ingredients make a difference."

There is a white cast, but it does fade and I use this when I know I am not going to be out with people. I also love using this product to get rid of pimples since it does not dry out skin like products with benzoyl peroxide.

I have mild acne so I am not sure how effective this would be for someone who has severe acne. Overall, I would recommend this and the jar last awhile since this is mostly a spot treatment. Last thing to note is I apply my moisturizer first and then this at the end so my face stays hydrated. I will be repurchasing when I run out of this cream."

Come out! At! All!
I figured well, maybe it was a an accident. So a month later I felt the same tingle, but i was at work...no cream with me. Still i put it on at home once the sore was all read and present...and it dried off. Mind! It's there. But if you ever had cold sores, you know that it's ichy, then scabs up...then f.ing bleeds and than slowly goes away. Not this time. It did not get inflamated and scabby at all, just kinda managably dry. (See picture) I just bought my second jar to keep in my purse for emergencies!

I had almost given up on this but I had one large and painful blemish that had just popped up on my chin and I was desperate to get rid of it. I put a thick layer of this on and went to bed. When I woke up, it was almost gone.

I’m still trying it out to see how it works best but it seems to help the most with inflamed pimples under the skin rather than whiteheads or popped pimples. It’s a little annoying to apply because it definitely leaves white spots on your face so they recommend to use it at night. The only problem with using it at night is that it doesn’t dry down so it wipes off really easily on your pillowcase. I have been applying it in the evening a few hours before bed so it has time to work before it is wiped off on my pillowcase."

You can expect to see results quite quickly. The morning after using this product, my skin was so soothed and much more even in tone. I thoroughly recommend this product to people who struggle with acne and redness because this cream made my acne scars less prominent and my overall skin less red.

Many reviewers found issues with a white cast. However, I found that the cream blended into my skin effortlessly. I suspect people with this specific qualm used too much of this product because I can see how layering more product can leave a white base. You do not and should not use a lot of this cream because a little goes a long way in addition to it being an objectively small amount of product.

The cream consistency is interesting because you would expect it to be heavy. With the way I apply it to my skin, the cream does not sit on top of the skin. Like aforementioned, it easily melted into the skin without clogging my pores.

Is it an essential product for the everyday person? No. But people who feel insecure about their redness and inflammation that comes from acne will enjoy this product."

The spot treatment seems to work fairly well on acne spots that occasionally crop up on my face. I usually have a few whiteheads which, after using the treatment at night, will disappear typically overnight. The most stubborn spots disappear from 24-48 hours with very minimal hyperpigmentation.

What is most impressive is how effective it is in calming irritation. I occasionally see a streak of red irritation on my cheek/jawline area after using the very strong AHA/BHA mask from The Ordinary once a week. At night, after rinsing off The Ordinary mask, I apply toner/essence (one from COSRX called the Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner mist, and another from Pyunkang Yul called the Essence Toner) to hydrate my skin. I follow up with moisturizer (Belif's True Cream Aqua Bomb) and then apply this spot treatment onto the red, irritated area. Overnight, the redness and irritation are gone!

My only minor gripe with the product is that it is fairly thick and opaque, and it does not absorb into the skin. Rather, it sits on top of the skin, and rubbing the product will only move it around onto the skin rather than working it INTO the skin. My solution is to use very little product and generally only use it at night. A little goes a long way with this stuff! Overall, I love it and think it's great for the price point. My boyfriend uses a way more expensive brand and, after trying my tub of COSRX spot treatment, has stated that after he goes through his expensive tube he'll just switch to COSRX instead!"

This time, I opened one and all the patches looked dried out. I tried using one overnight and when I pulled it off in the morning it was really sticky. It still seemed to absorb something but not as effectively as the prior batches. I opened another pack and it looked the same, so I initiated a return/refund request. Oddly they want me to send it back so I'm hoping they don't try to sell it to someone else.

These things make my whiteheads VANISH overnight without fail. It is the only foolproof way I know of, to get rid of a gross whitehead without popping it and risking aggravating it further. My pics show a small pimple, but I have used these patches on some real monsters and they work like a charm every time. I have used it on cystic acne (spots with no head), and it doesn’t have the same overnight-vanishing effect - but I would say it at least makes them a little less angry. So when I have a cystic bump, I’ll use a patch on it nightly, and it seems to go away a bit faster than normal.

Comfort: 10/10. So comfortable I’ve walked outside wearing it before by accident. They stay on very well overnight. The different sizes make it possible to use them pretty much anywhere. The only time they’re hard to use is if you get a pimple like on the corner of your lip, close to your eye, or in a place where the patch can’t fully adhere to the skin around the pimple. In those cases, it’s still usable, but you have to be careful so it doesn’t fall off.

Durability: 10/10. They’ve never ripped on me, and the packet they come in is resealable which makes them last a long time.

Appearance: 5/10. Similar to other brands of pimple patches, these things are definitely noticeable when worn. I only use them at nighttime, so this doesn’t really affect me.

Overall an amazing solution for getting rid of whiteheads in a fast, pain-free, and sanitary way."

I have sensitive, combination skin, and it’s hard to find a cleanser that cleans without stripping my face. This one ticks all the boxes—it’s gentle, effective, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed without any tightness.

The low pH formula really helps maintain my skin’s balance, which is important to avoid breakouts and irritation. I also love that it contains tea tree oil and BHA, which keep my pores clear and calm any redness. Even though it’s called a “morning” cleanser, I use it both day and night, and it works beautifully every time.

The gel texture feels soothing, and it lathers just the right amount without being too foamy. Plus, the 150 ml bottle lasts a long time since a little bit goes a long way. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a bonus for those with sensitive skin or anyone avoiding strong scents.

If you’re looking for a reliable, gentle daily cleanser that works for all skin types—especially sensitive or acne-prone—this one is a must-try! I’ll definitely be repurchasing."

I absolutely loved the clean but gentle feeling after washing, and the little to no fragrance, which is important first thing in the morning.

The most recent one I received has a strong floral fragrance, and I don't get the same clean feel when using. It's still gentle enough to use on sensitive skin, but is no longer my holy grail face wash.

Another indicator that this is a different product is the new packaging. The plastic is much harder, and the tamper proof over plastic covered the entire container (not just the lid)."

I suffer from very oily skin so finding a moisturizer that doesn’t add more oil to my face has been a mission.

I can say that I’m not disappointed. My skin wasn’t sensitive to this. It does the job it’s meant to do. I purchased it with their snail mucin product but it wasn’t a great combination for my skin. I’d get very red. After trying them separate I determined it was the snail mucin my skin responded to and not the moisturizer.

The only thing I don’t like is the smell. Not sure how I can describe it but I know it’s good that it’s not full of scents because that’s also bad. It’s not sticky or leaves any oily residue. My minus is only the smell, but it could be that my nose is just more sensitive to this scent. So please don’t feel discouraged to purchase if your thinking about it.

I will be purchasing this again for future moisturizer needs."

The app I used to check products is Yuka and they scored it 100/100, which is the best I found compared to the large brand name products. I just started using it less than a week ago after my shower and it is great. There is basically no grease residue left on my face after 30 minutes to an hour.

3.38 fl. oz. does seem to be a bit small but for the price and compared to other moisturizers from large brand names it is very competitive.

Overall, great for combining skin."

I didn’t have any expectations going into this product purchase - but I’ve been very happy with it.

The product absorbs very quickly and makes my face feel plump and hydrated. It’s also lightweight enough to be used directly on my eyes and eyelids, adding to the product’s versatility.

It’s very affordable and feels like it’s formulated with quality ingredients. The bottle has a pump that makes it very easy to dispense and a little goes a long way. The bottle is sizeable and lasts a long time.

I haven’t had any issues with breakouts besides a few small pimples when I first started using it. All skin care products can come with an adjustment period - so I’d encourage giving it at least 1-2 weeks to see how effective it is for your skin."

But thanks to my girlfriend's gentle nudging (and maybe a few too many comments about my ""dry patches""), I've entered the skincare world. And let me tell you, this COSRX Snail Mucin 92% Moisturizer is a revelation, particularly for someone who lives at high altitudes.

Here's why I'm now a snail mucin convert:

Hydration Hero: This stuff is like a tall glass of water for my face. It absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling hydrated and plump without any greasy residue. My dry patches have vanished, and my skin looks noticeably healthier.

Surprisingly Lightweight: I was worried about a thick, heavy cream, but this moisturizer is remarkably lightweight. It feels refreshing on my skin and doesn't clog my pores.

Visible Results: I've been using this moisturizer for a few weeks, and I can honestly say my skin looks and feels better. It's smoother, more even-toned, and has a healthy glow I haven't seen in years.

No Fuss, No Frills: As a skincare newbie, I appreciate the simplicity of this moisturizer. It's fragrance-free and contains no harsh ingredients that might irritate my skin.

Girlfriend-Approved: Most importantly, my girlfriend has noticed an improvement in my skin. That's a win in my book!

A Few Slimy (Minor) Considerations:

While I'm a big fan of this moisturizer, there are a couple of things to keep in mind based on other reviews:

The Snail Factor: Yes, it's made with snail mucin. This might not be your moisturizer if you're squeamish about that sort of thing. But trust me, it's not as slimy as it sounds!

Not for Everyone: While it works wonders for my dry skin, some reviewers with oily skin have found it a bit too rich. If you're unsure, it's always a good idea to do a patch test first.

Overall:

If you're looking for a hydrating, lightweight moisturizer that delivers visible results, the COSRX Snail Mucin 92% Moisturizer is a fantastic choice. It's been a game-changer for my skin, and I highly recommend it to anyone, especially fellow middle-aged guys new to the skincare world."

I see my face brighter, the texture is more even, and my skin color looks radiant. I really can't believe it.
I feared it would smell funny or feel meh, but no! I love the smell and the texture of the cream, which is as described.
You can apply your make-up perfectly after using this cream.

Did I say already that I'm impressed? :) I love this product! I'm happy I ran into it by luck!"

Only complaint I have is that they aren’t very wet, I wish they were a little more saturated bc when I get down to my neck they are already feeling dryer. Where with the stridex pads they are nice and soaked and I can get a ton of skin wiped down. But these are great for a gentle everyday exfoliating pad. They’re not a bad price either. -Edit* so update after using these for a few weeks. They are an ok toner pad don’t get me wrong, great if you have sensitive skin.

I wasn't a fan of their BHA power liquid back in the day and I primarily exfoliate with AHAs, so I decided to try this out by purchasing it during Prime Day. It's really convenient, comes with a tweezer so you can use it to pick up the pads conveniently & without contaminating all the pads. I use the pads once a day at night all over my face, but primarily concentrating on my nose. It is mildly stripping due to the nature of BHA, so highly recommend following up with the Cosrx snail essence or snail cream."

I switch between this and my tret and this gets out the stubborn blackheads out. Like within a day or two they start to come out of the skin (can really feel the hard bumps when washing my face) and when oil cleansing they usually wiggle and fall out. Sounds gross but it works! also minimizes my pores. I only use it only 2 times a week though because using too often will make my skin irritated. The Paula’s choice was too strong for me since I’m also using tret so if you’re looking for something gentle this product is great.

While he was using it to great success, I had the worst flair of my life of Seborrheic Dermatitis. Desperate as my class reunion was days away, I started using this twice a day as it as salicylic acid like properties. In two days the texture was vastly improved and flakes were minimal- by the forth day, the flaking, burning and itching were all gone. All that was left was mild redness that was easily covered with my medium coverage foundation. I continued to use this after the symptoms were gone as I also noticed improved skin texture and less definition in my wrinkles. I am ordering 2 more cans/ One for me and another for my son. He is also seeing a reduction in his acne scars."

It’s so hydrating and effective. I think I would thoroughly wash my face, but when I use these pads, it picks up all the remaining residue off my face I didn’t even realize was there. After use, your skin feels so tight and vibrant. I’ve tried to use other toner pads when I couldn’t get these ones after my years worth of them, and other brands irritated my eyes or had too much fragrance added into it. When I returned back to these I realized how gentle it was to my skin that I can easily also remove remaining eye makeup as well without burning my eyes. It’s truly top tier."

I’ve always had sensitive combination skin so usually when I wake up, my forehead is oily and around my mouth is dry and flaky. I’ve only used it once so far (last night), but when I woke up today my face was so moisturized I didn’t even want to wash it lol. Also I’m so glad it didn’t tingle or irritate my sensitive skin at all! I’m still feeling the hydration from the mask the night before. Also, I see a lot of people complaining about the stickiness but it’s not a bad slimy sticky, but a super moisturizing sticky. So it won’t bother you when trying to sleep. Or make you look funny when going to bed. Highly recommend!"

If your like me , you like to thoroughly do your reach especially when it comes to what you put on or in your body .

This face mask is absolutely under priced . I’m in shock just how well this face mask works !!!!!!! I have tried pretty much every line of skin care once . I’m only on day 3 and I wake up each time with my skin literally transforming over night . I did not realize of all my years of research and thousands spent on my skin regime that something as a nourishing RICE mask was the key component that was lacking . 😂

The texture is a hybrid between a serum and a moisturizer. It goes on creamy like silk , non greasy or heavy what so ever . No scent which I like as I have sensitive skin . Even vitamin C dries me out . I’m on the super dry end of skin types so this is Definitely a wonderful overnight hydrate . I wake up with Baby soft , dewy , poreless skin . It’s actually brightening it too to my surprise. (I don’t find many brightened that actually work on the market anymore unless it’s clinical & you’re ready to shell out $200+.)

I do want to note that I do use other products first BUT it’s the same steps I was doing when I would finish with the laneig water bank sleep mask . I did not have any results with that after a week I gave it to my bf and back to the drawing board looking for a deep hydrating over night mask . I found this one and I needed to share my feedback . There is probably someone out there like me just over the search and wasted money .

This mask is simply incredible. There is no other way to put it . I even canceled my laser facial as it’s no longer needed . 3 days my skin has drastically improved from elasticity , brightened and super moisturized .

Dont take this review lightly . I’m a super tough critic when it comes to skin & hair products. Every woman mid 30’s+ with dry skin needs this in her nightly skin routine . 🙌"

I have sensitive, dry skin that tends to get flaky, especially in colder months, and I’ve tried countless moisturizers. None have delivered the lasting hydration and soothing comfort that this cream provides.

Intense Hydration: This cream is packed with hyaluronic acid, which locks in moisture so effectively that my skin feels soft and plump all day. Even in dry weather, it keeps my face hydrated without needing to reapply. It absorbs quickly, so there’s no greasy residue—just a beautiful, dewy finish.

Perfect for Sensitive Skin: With no parabens, artificial fragrances, or animal testing involved, this product is gentle on sensitive skin. I’ve had no irritation or breakouts since using it, and it actually calms my skin if it feels tight or red. This cream is one of the few products I trust to use around my eyes because it’s so gentle!

Rich but Lightweight Texture: Although it’s a rich moisturizer, the texture is lightweight and non-sticky. It glides on smoothly and layers well under makeup without pilling. This is a huge plus for my morning routine as it makes my foundation look smoother and fresher for longer.

Long-Lasting and Affordable: A little goes a long way, so this 3.52 oz tub lasts for months, making it incredibly affordable for the quality you get. I’ve been using it daily for weeks, and I’m not even halfway through the jar.

Korean Skincare Quality: COSRX is a reliable brand in Korean skincare, known for its high-quality ingredients, and this product lives up to that reputation. The hyaluronic acid blend is highly effective, and I love that it’s cruelty-free.

If you have dry, sensitive skin or need a hydration boost, I can’t recommend the COSRX Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Cream enough. It’s become an absolute staple in my skincare, and I’ll definitely be repurchasing!"

Initially, I was excited to try this product as it promised to balance my skin's pH and reduce acne. However, after using it consistently for 2 weeks, I've started to experience a breakout - which is the opposite of what I was hoping for.

That being said, I do think this toner has helped to reduce the appearance of pores and has left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. The breakout could be due to a purging phase, but I'm not entirely sure.

I'll continue to use this product and see how my skin adjusts, but for now, I can only give it an average rating. If you're considering trying this toner, I'd recommend starting with a small patch test to see how your skin reacts."

But this toner is in a spray bottle, which is odd, but I decided to give it a chance. This toner dries WAY too fast, so you have to use so much for it to get where it needs to go. I’m talking 7 pumps directly on my face and another 3-4 pumps on a cotton round and it still dried out too fast. I went through a bottle of this stuff in about 2 and a half weeks. I can usually make any other toner last a little over one month.

As for the effects it had on my skin, I didn’t see a noticeable difference from the toner I was using previously. I wouldn’t say it was bad, but it also wasn’t anything to rave about. Overall, I didn’t think the longevity was worth the price."

One criticism is they are harder to remove from the plastic film. For some reason, the plastic film behind the patches has circle cut-outs, which sometimes come out with the patches so you may need a tweezer to gently remove them and avoid markings."

I don't use these for fighting acne because plain hydrocolloid patches don’t fight acne. Their job is to cover an open wound to help keep it clean and to turn any fluid seeping out of the wound into that white gel. I’ve seen people put these patches on closed pimples on their face and think that the white gel that formed on the patch is pus that somehow got sucked out of their pimple. Hydrocolloid doesn’t magically seep into the skin and then pull pimple gunk out onto the patch. You can actually put one of these patches on a clear part of your face and the natural oils that seep out from your skin will turn into the white gel substance on the patch. So all in all, I think these patches work great for what they were intended for. (FYI, my included review image doesn’t show the entire amount of patches I received in the package. I’ve used an entire row of them already.)"

SECOND. they ACTUALLY WORK. they stick so well and these ""invisible"" ones are actually super blendable with my skin. I've had so many people tell me that they couldn't even see the patches.

THIRD. There are SO MANY patches. and the tearaway sheet gives you the option the cut them in half if you need one at a night and ran out of the red ""Acne Pimple Patches"".

!! Also as a note, I highly recommend getting a pack of the red patches too! They're better used at night and since they come in a variety of sizes, you can cut them in half or quarters to get more for your money."

Hydrocolloid patches are the best way I have found to treat those. It makes them go away/flatten within a couple days and draws the ickiness to the surface. It also hides the redness a bit and keeps you from messing with the pimples. You end up with less swelling. The patches are not invisible but are definitely less noticeable and much thinner than Peach Slices ones. You couldn't wear them out in public but for quarantine they are perfect.

I have tried a number of different brands (Iconic Cosmetic, Peach Slices, another one CVS carries, and even the CosRX patches that come in the red package) and none of them compare. Most patches say they are invisible, but they are not. These patches were so invisible that I could not even see them on my own face!

Most patches also say they can be work under makeup, but end up looking very obvious with some foundation over them. These weren't invisible once I out foundation over them, but blended in much better than any other patch.

They also hold up pretty well with sweat and friction. I wore two during a 75 minute Muay Thai session that included sparring and, while they rippled a little and became somewhat less invisible, they stayed on well.

THE ONE DOWNSIDE: they are hard to get off the packaging without crinkling the patch (which makes it more noticable). You need to have fingernails and you need to be very careful. They also are more expensive than other patches. In light of that, I suggest using the red CosRX or iconic brand patches at night and saving these babies for bad days when you need some day-time coverage."

I’m in my mid-30s, and was fortunate to have relatively problem-free skin for most of my life. That all changed in the past year, likely due to a double whammy of stress and aging. I swear my skin aged at least 5-10 years during that time. I was breaking out regularly, and every painful cystic acne spot would turn into hyperpigmentation. Along with lamenting the damage being done to my skin, I noticed how horrible my pores had become - they were huge, and my fave was riddled with blackheads. I started trying everything I could - LED therapy, religiously using tretinoin, but then I decided to “go nuclear” with a laser treatment which only made my skin worse. Dejected, I decided to “go back to the basics”, and try to figure out what habits I could build that would improve my situation a little bit each day.
Long story short, I learned about Cosrx on Reddit when someone posted their results after using the blackhead power liquid. I did my research and learned that the ingredient they use to clear blackheads is ever so slightly different than most, and that makes it more effective. Well, Amazon was sold out of the blackhead liquid, and I was desperate, so I decided to go for this since the active ingredients are similar. I’m so glad I have this a try! It has definitely worked! It hasn’t completely eliminated my blackheads, but wow - they’ve definitely drastically reduced from what they used to be. I used to apply it with a reusable facial round, but now I apply it directly with my fingers, and I feel like it helps the product go farther, and actually be more effective since nearly 100% of it is going directly on my skin rather than absorbing into the facial round. It’s also incredibly gentle on my skin. I get no irritation at all. I’ve read about the importance of letting your products do their work before layering the next product on top, so I also allow this to sit for 20 minutes before I apply the next product. Yes, this means my routine takes longer, so, I now keep my products next to my bed and apply them at night before sleep while I watch some TV. For the price, this is a “holy grail” product I will continue to use, though I may give the blackhead one a go once I run out of this to see if there’s much of a difference between the two. In about two and a half months of near-daily use, I’ve gone through about a half a bottle, so I expect this to last me a while longer. For me, this makes it an excellent value. Every time I find a product like this that helps me get back skin that I don’t have to be quite so embarrassed about it’s a blessing. If your concerns are similar, I say give it a try."

This product has truly lived up to its name - my pores have been visibly reduced in size and my skin feels much smoother and more hydrated.

One thing that really stands out to me about this product is that it has not caused any sensitivity or irritation on my skin. Many products that claim to shrink pores tend to be quite harsh and strip the skin, but this one is very gentle and nourishing.

In addition to shrinking pores, this product has also helped to improve the overall texture and clarity of my skin. It feels much more balanced and healthy, and I am noticing a significant decrease in blemishes and breakouts.

Overall, I would highly recommend the COSRX Two in One Poreless Power Liquid to anyone looking to minimize the appearance of pores and improve the overall health and appearance of their skin. It has been an absolute game-changer for me and I will definitely be repurchasing in the future."

I don’t wear make up and don’t really know all steps of proper skin care so my pores were just getting worse and worse.
I have tried a lot of things, anything that claim to shrink your pores. Most of them had no effect whatsoever, a lot of them made me feel like they’re just plain water, they didn’t seem to do anything at all. Some other sting badly, gave me burning sensation.
This godsend Corsx liquid is different. It has cooling effect instead of stinging, and you can feel it working on your face, not like those “plain water”. It made my skin feel moist but not oily, and most important of all, it REALLY HELPS with the pores. They appear much much smaller. I don’t feel like a cratered moon anymore and i have only used it for a short time.
Better yet, it’s really afforable. So if you’re suffering from large pores, give it a try, i hope it would help you like it did to me."

It doesn't have that thickness that you feel that makes you despise to use it. It is thick when it comes out of the tube but applies well on skin over damp skin. Great barrier cream. I would say I recommend to apply this after a toner so that it is much easier for the cream to 'glide onto' as opposed to a dry face. If you don't have one you can use it right after drying your face after a shower since the steam makes your face damp. - could also use it after serum too so there is some barrier for the cream to smooth onto. I tried it without a 'prep step' and it didn't feel nice and felt tacky to the touch.
For me I like using this as a second layer of moisturizer after an emulsion (light-weight moisturizer) as a thicker consistency night cream. I only use it at night.
I love how it is 80ml. I would definitely repurchase. I used a good amount of this for a couple of months for me to really see if I like it and to review. I purchased through the COSRX website.
I wanted ceramides in my skincare routine and I thought the best step would be moisturizer! it's an easy one too since it acts as a great barrier ingredient. Highly recommend."

(My derm said both were okay, since they were wash off products.)

However, I noticed when I put on a regular, light weight moisturizer, my skin would sting a lot. I found out that this was because my skin barrier was damaged. I wear sunscreen, and don’t use any harsh chemical products, so I knew it was most likely due to my skin being too dry from my regular skincare routine. I figured my usual moisturizer wasn’t heavy enough to keep my skin hydrated. So I borrowed some of my boyfriends eczema cream from La Rochay Posay. It worked wonderfully, but I didn’t want to drop 15$ on a bottle for myself, so I looked for a cheaper alternative. When I bought it, this cream was cheaper (8$, what a steal!) Although it’s since gone back to its regular price (14$)

I love this product not only because it helped me repair my skin barrier, and keep my face hydrated, but also because I love the texture. It’s actually less like a cream, and more like a jelly. The consistency is a little bit similar to petroleum jelly, although not quite as “wet” as petroleum tends to be. And it glides on so smoothly. I only needed a pea-sized amount for my face. Once a day on most days, sometimes twice a day if my skin was super dry and irritated. Not to mention, the scent is a pleasant herbal smell. (No fragrance added tho!) I’ve also had no problems with it causing breakouts at all, despite the “heavy” consistency. Despite the price similarities, I would say I prefer this over the La Rochay Posay eczema cream, although both are great, high quality products."

For reference I’m early 30s, haven’t had break out since I was a teenager. I purchased this based on good anti-aging reviews. My skin was essentially very clear and glass like, I’m on the oilier side.

I started getting this tiny pimples that were like under the skin, not white head pimples but closed comedones. I have never dealt with this before in my life. They weren’t red or even noticeable so it didn’t concern me, but then each one has turned into a full blown white head, inflamed pimple that last weeks.

It’s been almost 2 months of it. I still have a few closed comedones and I’m terrified they will turn. Possibly fungal acne?

I can’t say this product caused it but I have never experienced anything like this before and this was the only real change in my routine. Discontinued use, no other effect noticed.

So I decided to try this since I didn’t want to pay a fortune for the SK2. I used like 2 bottles of this day and night. It doesn’t seem to cause any irritations except when I used glycolic acid peel, it causes burning and redness after I used the 10% glycolic acid serum. It goes on sticky if you don’t put it on the cotton pad, so it’s not as refreshing as the Missha one. I noticed my face is more DRY and my skin peels during the day when I used this product (I use tretinoin at night). So this product is definitely not hydrating at all despite that it has sarchomyces filtrate and hyaluronic acid. My skin can’t tolerate hyaluronic acid bc it just sucks out all the moisture out of my face instead of making it more hydrated.

Now I’m not able to use snail mucin (by the same brand-cos rx) anymore as it does break me out, but I would say this product, in comparison, to that one is a bit overwhelming. Now this is a completely different formula and completely different concerns are targeted… This one I would say is most known for targeting wrinkles and age lines. Has very little hydration, very little help with dark spots but can help with texture (not including pores). If you’re someone who’s young and their skin is fairly in their prime, this may not target your concerns. I’m 24, and for me, this did almost absolutely nothing after using it since I bought it, so a couple of months. I did end up switching to the same brands hydration essence and am a lot happier. Make sure to pay attention and look up what essences are good for your concerns and not go to social media for everything- after hearing how good this was and was a dupe for a popular product I thought that it would help me more than it has!"

Once it dried (before I added the rest of my skincare) I felt lifted and smooth and really clean. This formula is super thin and a little goes a long way. I’ve added it into my routine morning and night and seen DRAMATIC changes in my skin’s texture and elasticity. I’ve also seen a lot of improvement in my stubborn hyperpigmentation.

Upon receiving the package, I noticed that the essence liquid had leaked out, causing a mess and potential damage to other items. To my surprise, this issue seems to be a recurring problem, as I discovered through other customers' reviews. It is disheartening that despite this recurring issue, there has been no noticeable improvement in the product's packaging or quality control.

I must admit that the essence itself is of good quality, and its fast absorption provides an instant moisturizing effect. The formula lives up to its claims, delivering the desired benefits for the skin. However, the consistent problem of leakage during transit tarnishes the overall experience and raises concerns about the company's commitment to customer satisfaction."

I highly recommend this AHA for anyone struggling with whiteheads/closed comedones. I’ve been struggling with them for about 4 years and in 4 weeks, this AHA has done more for me than any of the many products I’ve tried in the last 4 years. One important thing to note is that it’s very important to apply it correctly. I stick to applying it only every other night (never in the morning) so as not to over exfoliate, immediately after cleansing (before toner, serum, etc), and I wait 20-30 minutes before applying the rest of my skincare. I wait that long because other products tend to have pH levels too close to natural skin pH, which can mess with the efficacy of the AHA so it will work best if you allow the AHA ample time to sit without interruption by other products. Seriously this changed the game for me!!

I have combination skin, and this didn’t break me out at all."

I tried everything, and it only got worse. I have sensitive skin, and prone to whiteheads because I’m athletic, but I’m meticulous about my skincare and I’ve never had a breakout like this since I was a wee teenager over 20 years ago!
Saw this at Marshall’s but didn’t think much, and I was skeptical about this, considering I’ve been able to manage existing whiteheads with exfoliation and extractions. But things got so bad, I decided to give this a shot.
One week in.. ALL of my whiteheads are gone! Literally. On first use, I noticed it immediately helped get rid of surface skin which allowed easier access to the gunk underneath. There was some tingling and minor irritation after using it once I exfoliated, but saw results immediately within first use. I used it every other day over the week, not recommending anyone do the same, but it’s completely cleared up my skin that was previously covered in whiteheads and bumps. It really just goes in and somehow gets rid of the surface skin that clogs my pores and allows the dirt causing my skin and whiteheads to just come out, without having to do any extractions or anything!
Cannot recommend this enough, so grateful for CORSX and their line of skincare products. Never have I found anything to help me get rid of my biggest issue until now, and I no longer pick or mess up my face :)"

This power liquid means business when it comes to tackling whiteheads. The 7% glycolic acid exfoliates and unclogs pores, effectively removing whiteheads and promoting a smoother complexion.

Minimized Pores (5/5):
The AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid has helped reduce the appearance of pores, giving my skin a smoother and more refined texture. It's particularly effective on stubborn areas like the T-zone.

Since i have very dry skin, I followed with a moisturizer and my face looks great. It does tingle a little, but like i said, it may be because of my dry skin.
I highly recommend it! I'm very glad i bought it."

I hate products that I can FEEL on my skin and this doesn't even feel like I applied it. I use it right in my nightly routine following the thinnest to thickest application process. You could definitely use this morning and night. I have to stop myself from applying to much because of how nicely it absorbs. Has not made me break out so far.

This is a lightweight moisturizer that does not irritate my rosacea-prone skin. It gives a nice glow -- not that ""faux glow"" from oil or something greasy looking/feeling but from healthy nourished hydrated skin.

I use this as my last step - unless I want a heavier moisturizer or an oil over it, on occasion when I want or need extra moisturizing.

I can compare this to BOJ Dynasty Cream but this Cosrx moisturizer doesn't have the sticky feeling that Dynasty cream has, so I prefer this one (even though I love BOJ, too).

I have dehydrated and combination skin, so keeping up with my skin barrier and pairing exfoliants are a must. As such, I don't need a heavy oil-based moisturizer that leaves my face shiny and lacks hydration. Or a gel moisturizer that's too light and lacks moisture. These ingredients are exactly what my skin needs. In addition, this can work with active ingredients, so it's multi-purpose. This hydrating gel moisturizer is the perfect middle and has a light scent. I've seen someone people say it doesn't last and personally, this lasts me at least 2, max 3 months. A little goes a long way since it's thin but moisturizer. It's has a similar texture of La Roche Posay Hydrating Cleasner. In the end, while I change my skincare routine to try other products, this will always be in my rotation if my skin decides to act up. I understand why some may say it leaves them shiny and I don't discred them. Depending on my skin I'll use different amounts or products. However, for sleep, I always wake up with radiant and dewy skin. My face feels light, full, moisturized and breathable. Especially when you find the perfect ingredients to pair with this moisturizer.

Cerave cream that I've been using felt a little too heavy and caused excessive sweating on the hot days.

This product has a lighter texture but turned out to be not much different from Cerave moisturizer. There really isn't anything special about it. No fragrance to speak of and packaging design is plain. You don't get that feel of luxury from using it. If you're looking for an inexpensive but effective moisturizer, then I recommend Cerave that costs much less for a bigger jar. I didn't find any advantage in using this more expensive product. The feel on the face was almost the same and moisturizing effect was slightly less. Meh."

This light lotion is perfect with those with acne prone skin. Apply this after using the Cosrx AC Toner and press into the skin. This is so soothing. I have a small acne issue around my nose and this calmed everything down when used with the toner. The second ingredient is aloe vera which really impresses me. Most lotions start with water as the first ingredient. While this is a bit more expensive than drug store brands, there is nothing bad in the ingredients.

Madecassic Acid: calms and protects the skin
Asiatic Acid: balances and strengthens skin's barrier
Aloe Vera Leaves, Propolis Extract & Green Tea Extract: moisturize the skin and soothe irritation
Niacinamide & Zinc PCA: control excess oiliness

This moisturizer has a nice pleasant scent. It is lightweight and absorbs quickly into my skin without leaving a heavy or greasy residue behind. It is a little tacky for a short period of time.

I was pleased with this lotion - not sure it will replace my daily moisturizer once it's gone, but I did like the fact it was lightweight and didn't sting my skin. It didn't moisturize as much as I would like, and because my skin still felt a little tight even after application, I followed it with a thin layer of my regular moisturizer.

It wavers back and forth from being super dry and super oily. Lately it’s been on the dryer side but I still have some excess oil upon waking up in the morning and towards the very end of the day. I get cystic acne time to time that takes forever to go away so it is very important to me to find a product that is non-comedogenic and will not clog my pores or lead to a lot of excess oil.

I gave this product a test run (been using it almost 2 and a half weeks now) because I was looking to see if I could find a better moisturizer than the one I have currently (the cereve lightweight nighttime moisturizer)

First for the positive notes: it went on smoothly, didn’t feel too thick or too lightweight, it had a pleasant smell, it didn’t feel tooo oily but it left a thin layer of residue that resembled oil. It felt relatively hydrating and I didn’t need to use a lot of it to get the job done. It also didn’t mess with my super sensitive skin like some other products will do.

And for the parts I was disappointed with: It left a small film over my skin after application that didn’t go away even with time. It didn’t play well with the retinol serum I like to use at night. Although moisturizing, it caused my face to be extremely oily upon waking up even if my skin was dry the previous night. Lastly, I believe this moisturizer is now causing me to break out. I have new acne patches that keep appearing.

I kept using the product hoping maybe it was a coincidence that I had more acne but the acne just kept coming.

I am sure this would be great for skin that isn’t acne prone, but sadly since I am, I can’t use this product.

I wish you luck in finding the best product for you!"

It works very well with my type 1 rosacea-prone skin so I don't have redness or irritation or itchiness. Even their stronger formula vitamin c and niacinamide doesn't irritate my skin. Just a beautiful brand, and very reasonably priced.

This propolis cream is light but it's also very emollient and creamy. I compare it to their moisture power enriched cream and this full fit cream is a little more smother and creamier, though both are excellent.

This feels like silk going onto my skin. I look for the experience of my skincare as being important too, and this didn't disappoint. And, again, zero irritation.

This is just over 2 ounces - a little goes a long way so it should last a while. I ordered it on a Black Friday deal so I'm super happy about that savings, but even at full price it is a bargain.

Also, hours after I wrote this review, my skin is still glowing so it isn't that 'faux glow' you can initially have from skincare, but a lasting healthy beautiful glow - and on aging skin that says even more about this beautiful cream.

I seldom wear makeup these days but do like to use skincare products. Last winter my face felt dry as I was using some all natural products. This winter I decided to try Corsx products and my face feels moist and moisturized. The toner is just the first step, but it’s a very nice toner. I do wish it was in a spray bottle because I always seem to make a mess using it. To begin with I tried applying with a cotton pad, but you waste a lot of product that way so now I just squirt it on my fingertips and apply that way, but inevitably I drop some in the sink."

UPDATE 11/16: Larger bottle from amazon is a watery consistency and not the same as smaller bottle. I decided to go purchase the smaller size in ulta and this bottle is more similar to the first one i got. The consistency is supposed to be slightly thick and not watery. I will not be purchasing this toner from amazon again. I don’t know where they’re getting their products from but that bottle was not the same.

This toner is no exception- lots of propolis extract at the top of a short ingredients list. It's also fragrance-free (like, really, zero scent).
But my skin says...meh? It just doesn't seem to be offering soothing/brightening (or moisture) that I got from my previous Bombee Honey Moist Toner. I honestly didn't think much of the Bombee at the time, but am a bit disappointed since using the CosRx. Sometimes you only notice the difference a product made when you stop using it, right?
I don't know why one works better for me than the other. I'm sure the CosRx is quality and would be very good for others. It's just not clicking with my skin chemistry."

Love the convenient flip cap packaging, no need for a twist cap. Solid plastic bottle with ink labeling (better than paper which eventually gets wrinkly when wet). About $20 for 10 fl oz is also a great deal.

The texture is lightweight and layerable. It soaks in so easily without ever feeling sticky or tacky on my normal/sensitive skin. I hate anything sticky and use this comfortably. There's a slight thickness and slip to it and yet no stickiness. Love that about it. It also leaves a nice subtle glow afterward. For me, sometimes I'll just use this toner after cleansing and call it a day, no additional moisturizer.

But the most unexpected benefit was when my hands were dry & peeling from over washing. I used this toner to hydrate my hands and it healed them much quicker than any hand cream or moisturizer!! Of course it also left them soft and supple. Just for that reason I would keep on repurchasing, as a multipurpose toner for my face and body.

Holy grail products have to be effective and packaged well. This checks both boxes for me.
(In comparison, the I'm From Rice Toner has a twist cap with paper labeling; the Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner has a flip cap but paper labeling and oddly left dry patches sometimes; etc.)"

But be wary though, an exfoliating toner WILL make you purge the first couple of uses. It’s SOOO important to SLOWLY incorporate new skincare into your routine!! Don’t get carried away with using everything all at once like I did lol, especially with exfoliants because their job is to encourage skin cell turnover which could irritate your skin at first!

I've seen far too many reviews where people say something along the lines of ""used for 2 weeks, made my skin worse."" However, if you have done any research about chemical exfoliants you'd know it takes a while for your skin to get used to these types as products and this results in purge acne. The cool thing about purge acne is it is all pimples you were already going to get! That's right, chemical exfoliants speed up the process of clearing out those pores. After the purge acne has completed, you are left with soft, supple skin that will never ever have to see any kind of damaging face scrub again. Seriously though, physical exfoliants (face scrub) just damage the skin leading to more acne. If you love your friends, you'll tell them to quit using anything with chunks, sugar or dreaded microplastics in it and to get this stuff. End rant, on the the official review.

I love this stuff! I live in a high altitude and dry area and finding a toner that didn't make my face feel tight was everything. Along with acne prone skin made worse by dryness, this stuff has truly been a miracle for my skin. I use it twice a day and have had the smoothest, least irritated skin of my life. Highly recommend!"

I use 2-3 pumps on my face & neck after cleansing to prepare for serums. There is little-to-no scent and no residue or film left after tapping in. Spraying it on is refreshing, though I'm sure applying it with a cotton pad would be just as effective. I love all the CosRx products I have tried and this is a constant in my daily skincare routine. I also ordered direct from the company and they included a full 3-step nose blackhead strip set which was awesome (I gave it to my daughter as she has a tendency for blackheads).

It’s a relatively inexpensive brand, but works IMO and experience as well as high end.

This toner contains AHA and BHA so it really helps even out your complexion and remove dead skin. I have combo skin, occasional hormonal acne and aging (over 50). This is gentle enough not to aggravate my skin (it doesn’t burn or turn red) and isn’t greasy or heavy.

They apparently just changed their packaging so it’s over 9 ounces and got rid of the spray applicator. That’s almost double what it was before and the price did go up but not double (I think it was $14 before and is $20 now).

Anyway, I use this serum at night after the propolis toner and before the rest of my night night products from COSRX and I wake up with healthy, soft, plump, glowing skin every morning.
It is very easy to apply, especially cold, and it absorbs in seconds without making my moisturizer weird and stuff. lol

No scent or alcohol what so ever so its perfect for us guys that want the benefits without smelling like a flower all day.

It was one of the first acne patch products I've used. The price honestly is not worth it for me this time. It was thinner and didn't perform as well as I remembered.

I upon them a walmart and they're like ~$4-5 bucks for 36 patches. So you can see why I'm disappointed. I won't be buying from cosrx for awhile.

Pimple patches are A NECESSITY and no longer luxury in my life. If you ask me what I will take on a desert island, THESE definitely would come with me. Sometimes I get some nasty A** pustules before my cycle and they ofc wanna pop up on my face on the areas that you just can’t help but stare at. When one of those babies decide to come live on my face for a min (rent free at that) I go in like LIL WAYNE and pop them to get the excess BULL out and use one of these patches to cover the crime scene. They work best for me overnight (and during the daytime if you have somewhere to go). You will actually see the patch soak up allllll that juicy juice and you are left with a nice flat red dead redemption. Sometimes if you don’t get it all on one shot, just go in with another one until it is healed. I found that once’s it’s pretty flat I can let them heal on it’s own without the extra reinforcement and they flake off quicker. These give me so much satisfaction knowing that if someone is gonna stare at my face, I now have a HATA BLOCKA and they can’t wish for it to grow back cuz IT WONT. BOOYA 💥"

I have deep cystic hormonal acne around the jaw. Depending on how deep and big the pimple is using these patches on a continual cycle (of about 6-8 hours per patch) will speed up the process of the pimple reaching the top layers of my skin. Some are done and gone in a day while others take about 2-4 days. I really thought results like this were impossible.

My 11.5 son already has acne and has had it for a few years already. He unfortunately inherited his Dad’s super oily skin. I’ve got him on a good skincare regimen, but he’s still a kid and touches his face too much. We probably have 6-7 brands of acne patches. This one is the absolute best for pimples (but not deep under the skin zits). It reduces the size of the pimple, bringing it to a head and more importantly, the Centella extract on the patch reduces redness dramatically in just one application. Most non-microneedling patches don’t have this ingredient. It’s also very thin, stays on and is matte so that my son can wear it while he going to school remotely all day and it’s not noticeable in camera. And it’s the correct shape, the oval covers and adheres much better than the circle shape."

When I’m stressed, my skin shows it. And of course, I can’t help but to pick at the biggest, ugliest pimples and turn them into mountains.

These patches adhere really well to the skin and don’t come off until it’s time. I’d be careful putting a patch over injured skin if you plan on prematurely removing it because chances are you’d rip open a wound, they stick that much. You’ll know when the patch is ready to come off because it’s loose at the center, appears “full”, and the edges give easily with some gentle pulling.

These patches are great because once I’ve got one on; I can’t pick at my skin anymore. They also really do work, and suck out whatever is in the pimple and after a day or so the patch falls off, in my case leaving a smooth but noticeable red mark that will eventually fade on its own. It really does help especially if you’re like me and can’t help but to pick. Please let me know if my review helped you by clicking the helpful button:)"

Worked extremely well, skin was glowing. Past one month, weather started to get little warmer and my skin started to become red. I was using isntree purple onion spf 30 sunscreen the entire time without exception each day. Cleanser was cosrx hydrium triple hyaluronic. I think maybe this cleanser is not strong enough(?) It is a big bottle, probably wont finish until maybe 6-8 months or even 1 year. It has been 4 months. I swapped to torriden dive in cream after the redness just kept getting worse, but similar issue. Not as much redness as aestura. Considering seeing dermatologist to find out what works best for me. From what I can tell I have combination skin."

It leaves your skin really smoothe and not too dry.

I use this product before I apply a toner and then my SPF sunscreen. My skincare routine is really simple and this is definitely the star of the show. Does exactly what it’s supposed to with the added benefit of being smooth and smelling relatively nice. I am a dude so the smell is not really my cup of tea however I do really like the product.

The smell is light and fresh and a little goes a long way (compared to the GMPH, which doesn’t foam up as much). I have oily skin and It leaves my face soft and clean without it stripping my natural oils and feeling overly dry. I wear full coverage makeup and this is my go to for double cleansing!"

I changed my face skin serum and moisturizer in Spring (around May). The plan was to switch to a lighter one for the summer season. My skin texture has changed a lot. I'm in the perimenopausal phase and just turned 50. I never have a skin problem apart from discoloration from being outdoorsy and a little lazy to use extra SPF. But, once Im getting older my pores are wider and I have lots of little bumps like whiteheads. That's never happened before. Plus fine lines on my forehead, crowfeet on the corner of my eyes, and neckline. Anyway, I ordered the serum and Snail Musin 92% face moisturizer and use it in the morning and I use the serum with my other retinol night cream (not COSRX) in the evening. After using this product for over 6 months I saw great results. Fine lines are reduced significantly, skin pores get smaller and the whiteheads disappear! My facial skin is glowing looks healthy and feels smooth. I'm ordering my 2nd bottle of the serum and will need to order the moisturizer probably next month. I just ordered a bundle of the serum with the Vitamin C serum. Normally I have to order facial serum and moisturizer between 3-4 months. But this product I use it for over 6 months. It's because they're so light and easy to absorb on the skin and have no scents or perfumes. For the price they're reasonable. I'm thinking of buying the facial wash soap but I love my Cetaphil Hydration face wash and toner and religiously use them because it didn't make my skin dry after washing. I hope this review helps ladies who are in the same phase as me and have similar skin conditions. Always order the product from their store, not another seller (normally selling at a cheaper price) because lots of fake products, read each product's characteristics so you can order the one that is right for your skin. Happy shopping! 🤗"

I think it does help brighten dull skin, but in my case not so noticably that I would be eager to repurchase if I didn't have the pore issue (my skin isn't in great condition in general). However, if I had drier skin in general, I think this product would be a great fit!

I'm still giving it 4 stars since it has great ingredients and does the job, even if it didn't work for me. I would still recommend this to someone else, if it was targeted for their skin concerns or for maintenance with someone who has clear skin."

Who knew snail slime could make your skin look this great?! I was very skeptical at first—after all, slathering snail goo on your face wasn’t exactly anything I’d ever heard of before. But COSRX Advanced Snail Radiance Dual Essence has seriously surprised me! (Really everything I’ve tried by this brand has!) This stuff in particular makes my skin SO hydrated and glowing and is super lightweight. I use it immediately after washing my face (day and night), before my face lotion.

The dual pump design is super fancy too—and it delivers the perfect amount of product every time so no waste. I’ve been using for about 3 months now and my skin has never been smoother! I’ve experienced less redness, and such a gorgeous glow that I didn’t know was possible as an extremely stressed 33 year old. If you’re up for a little slimy magic, give it a try. You absolutely won’t regret it!"

This does not replace a moisturizer as my skin still needed moisturizer after application. I was using Estée Lauder night serum for the last 9 years but wanted to try something else. I would even say this snail mucin is comparable to the Estée Lauder just based off of how my skin behaves with both serums. Honestly I would even say the snail mucin is better😧. I have been using for 1 month and so far so good!

Cosrx is hit or miss for me but I keep trying b/c my preferred brands (Yonka, Paula's Choice, L’Occitain) are comparatively expensive. After reading the 5 star reviews I decided to try this hoping to mitigate using PC cleanser and save some money. This was supposed to hydrate but it’s more like a hydration stripper on me. I have to rebalance the stripping effect by using the most nourishing moisturizers I own. After one use I’ve decided to return it before I start breaking out.

Pros
Great texture while using.

Cons
Smells strong, and similar to gain power wash for dishes
After rinsing skin felt stripped, dry and tight immediately
Tested on body and same reaction
With all the conflicting reviews it seems there may be a quality control issue

If you buy I hope you don’t join the ONE STAR club."

Using this face wash with the Advanced Snail92 All in one Cream along with the Advanced Snail 96 mucin 96 mucin power Essence for a month and just added their Hyaluronic Acid intensive cream last week. I've seen a huge difference. Especially in the lines around my mouth. My skin feels so much better. Less itching. I just ordered some of the products. Cleanser, cream, Essence for my son who has extremely sensitive skin as well."

For a long while I was using the cetaphil facial cleanser and it left my skin feeling and looking dry and my face didn’t feel as clean. But after my first use using this facial cleanser I don’t see any dry patches on my face and my face feels smooth and clean! All you need is to apply just a little bit and it lathers your whole entire face without adding more. It arrived in perfect condition no leakage through the bottle. I think I might buy another one, but it’s still too soon to tell since I only tried it once. So far it cleansed my face good, I’m going to throw my other facial cleanser and continue to use this one, it’s that good to me!"

They have all seen results on those of us who use it and then go for it themselves, lol. Most of us use this to shave with as well. You can work up a decent lather with it. Combined with the 96% gel, it's a simple routine that keeps skin looking great. At night you do a three step: Rinse with warm water very thoroughly first, then apply and lather, then rinse and repeat, dry and apply 96% Gel when done.

Since then I truly haven't looked back. There was one time early this year when I wanted to try something else for fun, so I purchased a facewash from Beauty of Joseon and that broke me out and I came back to my holy grail after learning my lesson. This facewash has never failed me and it never will. I love how thick it is and how it lathers. The way I wash my face is by opening up my pores with warm water- more on the hot side but not the type of hot that's uncomfortable on the skin- and then I'll put some of the cleanser on my fingers, rub my fingers together until it's like a paste (?) and then wash my face. I wash my face for about a minute, then rinse with cold water. I have had this cleanser on auto-replenish since trying it out for the first time. I love it so much and I can't get enough of it. 10/10 recommend."

I tried the snail face wash, serum, face cream and eye cream. Only made it one day and I had to stop. None of these products actually moisturized my skin, but dried it out instantly. I kept reapplying the lotions to see if it would help (winter in Wisconsin and all, ok maybe I needed a little more to get going). Wrong! By the end of the first day, my PD was flaring up, when it had been dormant for a bit. I was getting the red, burning dry spots to either side of my mouth and a red patch under my left eye. I stopped after a day and went back to coconut oil and olive oil. My skin is recovering, but sadly I am still searching for the right product for me. 0/10 stars, absolutely would not recommend!"

I have rosacea, and my skin is very sensitive, so I was very hesitant all the benefit claims. But this brand works so much better than my previous (much more expensive) facial cleanser products. It doesn't dry my skin; I can feel that after I wash my face, my skin feels refreshed instead of slowly tightening with dryness/irritation. Instead of needing to rush through patting my skin dry so I can quickly slap the moisturizer on, now I can take my time.

The cleanser is easy to use. The texture is like a gel cleanser, but it foams easily.
There's no scent at all. Like the moisturer, a little goes a long way, and that makes it very affordable.

My skin has been looking so much clearer, brighter, and glowy since I switched my skin care products. I'm so happy to have made the switch."

All I know is, the first day I used this I started to itch. I didn't connect it right away. For the next three days I used it I itched worse & worse each day. Finally stopped using it & went back to what I'd been using before today & the itching is entirely gone already.

My son is going to try it. I'll update after he does. If he's fine, maybe there is something in it I'm allergic to. If he has problems it's going in the trash."

**Texture and Application**: The texture is smooth and easy to spread, making application a breeze. It glides on effortlessly and has a pleasant scent that adds to the overall experience. I appreciate that it doesn’t feel heavy or greasy on the skin.

**Results**: After leaving it on for the recommended time, I rinsed it off and was amazed at how soft and hydrated my skin felt. It visibly brightened my complexion and gave me a nice, healthy glow. My skin felt refreshed and rejuvenated, which is exactly what I was hoping for!

**Ingredients**: I love that this mask is formulated with natural ingredients. Knowing that I’m treating my skin with quality components makes me feel good about using it regularly. Plus, it's free from harsh chemicals, which is a huge plus for sensitive skin like mine.

**Value for Money**: The price point is reasonable for the quality and results it delivers. A little goes a long way, so I can see this lasting me quite a while.

**Final Thoughts**: Overall, I highly recommend the [Face Mask Brand/Type] to anyone looking to pamper their skin. It’s become a staple in my skincare routine, and I can’t wait to try more products from this brand. If you're in need of a little self-care, this mask is definitely worth a try!"

My skin feels so soft and plump after each use, and it gives me that dewy glow I absolutely love. The snail mucin is great for boosting moisture and repairing skin, which makes this sheet mask perfect for anyone dealing with dry or dull skin.

However, I did find that there’s almost too much essence in each mask—so much that it tends to drip and get a bit messy. While I appreciate the extra hydration, it feels like a lot of it goes to waste, and the texture is definitely on the slimy side. I wish they could balance the amount of mucin better to avoid that overly sticky feeling.

Despite that, the results are worth it, and I usually pat in any extra essence on my neck and arms, so it’s not completely wasted. Overall, if you’re looking for an intensely moisturizing mask, this one will definitely do the trick—just be prepared for a little slime overload."

I love taking care of my skin due to how hydrated it has become and how soft after using this. It’s very effective.

It is extremely easy to apply. You do NOT have to wear this to sleep which most people and influencers do but you do not. However I do lol.

I don’t believe there is a smell. Maybe I just can’t tell? So even if there is one, it is not strong.

This overnight mask is a true gem for anyone with dry, aging skin, especially during the winter season. The texture is rich and luxurious, and upon application, it feels incredibly soothing and hydrating. The mask is absorbed quickly, leaving my skin feeling soft, plump, and deeply moisturized.

The Cosrx Overnight Mask is gentle yet powerful, and I appreciate that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. The formulation is packed with beneficial ingredients that work together to replenish moisture and improve skin texture over time.

I do wear this overnight occasionally, but more as an extra layer of skincare when my face is extra dry of sensitive. I’ve had it during the winter (literally HAD IT! 🤣🤣🤣) in New England and we get COLD and our skin gets DRY!
I definitely recommend this if your skin needs some extra lovin, or you just want some good skincare on your face to bring the hydration back!!!"

Every product in this kit is fantastic on its own, and is definitely worth the money.

1) cleanser: it's not too stripping or drying, yet makes your face feel quite clean. Fun gel texture that lathers up pretty well, and a fun little citrus-y clean scent that isn't too overpowering, either.
2) essence: very thicc, seems gooey and sticky, but is seriously moisturizing. It does not irritate my normal/dry skin, and I use it at least once a day, if not twice.
3) eye cream: smooth, creamy, sinks in really well and hydrates deeply. I can't say it de-wrinkles my designer eye bags or makes them less noticeable, but it definitely helps moisturize and prepare the skin for color correcting and concealer.
4) face cream: the best ever. just do it.

I myself have previously purchased full sizes of the essence, the eye cream, and the face cream, and I am considering getting the cleanser when my current one runs out.

anyways, this is worth it, just to try the products, although I guess you run the risk of falling in love with all the products."

Now that I’m going through “the change” I’ve noticed my skin is a tad dry. This was recommended by a friend so I decided to give it a whirl. First of all, I’m a nurse and I need an easy routine or I just flat out won’t do it. This is very simple. Secondly, my husband is allergic to perfume so I am very careful about making sure products I use are unscented and this has no real discernible scent. Thirdly it’s quite inexpensive (I bought the full size products and paid less than what I’ve paid for a single face cream) and Fourth… it works!! I’ve always been complimented on my skin, but wow. I noticed a huge difference in my skins texture and suppleness. My face feels well moisturized without being oily. Love this system!!"

my face is so freaking soft now! i put it on at night after washing, and in the morning my face still feels like fresh baby booty. and i'm 38 and a sun-worn raisin, so the effects are more immediate and dramatic than i would have expected. i'll be continuing to use this brand.

my only complaints are that the toner bottle doesn't have easy-use opening (you shake it/slap it on your skin to get a drop out?) and there aren't any instructions so i'm not quite sure if its best to use them in the morning, at night, in what order, how much, whether there's specific areas i'm supposed to target for each liquid, etc? i don't know what i'm doing."

It tends to get worse (dry, cracked, painful skin) in winter and these days mostly on hands. This cream is not a miracle cure-all overnight treatment by all means. However, it gets skin from nicely moisturized, prevents new inflammation areas, and so far has been slowly getting my skin to heal back to normal. All that in the middle of the winter in freezing outdoors and super-dry indoors.

It’s not for everyone obviously. Even though it barely smells to me for the entirety of a minute (which is good: couldn’t get myself to use the last cerave I got in the pharmacy), it still got citrus (limonene and bergamot oil) in ingredients. So I’d probably not use it in summer with direct sunlight.

But so far this is one of the better non-prescription products I’ve used, moisturizing and healing."

Ok, as others have stated these do slide a little- if upright. I have worn these while getting ready and need to reposition 1-2 times. But it’s absolutely not a deal breaker. I have also slept in them and they dont slide at all, so thats the best way to use them. If you can tolerate the sliding they are great to use as your skin is dewey and glowing after use. Would highly reccomend. Especially since they are very affordable. I have used expensive medical grade eye serums, and honestly will probably just stick with these."

Not these patches.
First, they have a shape that is obnoxious. They are too big and they slip down the cheeks. At first I thought I had a faulty item because they are not cut as usually eye patches are, that from a circle you can get two.
Not here. From a circle you have one eye patch and a tiny leftover piece that I don’t know what to do with it, as it is too small.
Also, they just don’t work in any way on puffiness, tiredness, glow, etc they just give you a nice sensation of freshness but that doesn’t turn into a result.
They might be good for a 20 years old that is already perfect and don’t really need them.

They are super slimey & slippery so they can slide around if you are not stationary while having them on but you can easily just slide them back into place.

One lower larger patch and a top patch. At first it’s a little awkward and unnerving since most eye patches are just a small lower patch. Hear me out though. This is an amazing design! It allows you to cover your upper eyelid, all of you under eye and your crow eye area. It slides a little bit, but that’s because there is an abundance of product, which is amazing. My skin feels so hydrated and soft after. You can actually see a difference using this product. Highly recommend this product and any produced by this company."

While the hydrogel patches adhere initially, they often struggle to stay in place until they fully dry, which can be frustrating. Despite this drawback, I've found that the patches provide a cooling sensation and deliver a boost of moisture to the delicate under-eye area. The snail mucin content offers some additional nourishment, leaving the skin feeling soft and refreshed. However, the slipping issue detracts from the overall experience and limits the effectiveness of the product. Overall, while the COSRX Advanced Snail Hydrogel Eye Patch has its merits, its inability to stay in place until dry prevents it from reaching its full potential as a standout eye care product."

However, when I'm tired, they are very prominent.

These are part of my morning routine - brush teeth, wash face, tone, eye gels while I do other morning stuff. Then I take these off and moisturize with my regular skincare and I can do makeup and whatever else.
These are slimy, but I just run them against the rim of the jar as I take them out and it gets the excess slime off. There's still plenty of goo, but they don't slide so much.
They're super hydrating, help massively with puffiness and mitigate my dark circles some. They're very soothing.
My under eye area is wildly sensitive. I get rashes and/or sensitivity from most under eye creams etc. I find these don't bother them at all. They feel so good and calming, and work so well.

COSRX Pure Fit Cica Smoothing Cleansing Balm, 4.05 fl oz / 120ml | Deep Hydrating Meltaway Cleanse for Sensitive Skin

One scoop was enough to remove my full make-up face (liquid eyeliner, mascara, foundation, glitter shadows, and lipstick). Once you start to rub it in your hand and on your face, it melts and becomes an oil-like texture. And it didn't make my skin dry or break out after use. I recommend."

This definitely falls into the latter category. The experience is much more akin to using an oil cleanser and, like many oil cleansers, it leaves behind a faint greasy residue on my skin. In terms of ingredients, not surprisingly this contains a rogues gallery of botanical oils, including coconut, lavender, sunflower, eucalyptus leaf, olive, sweet almond and jojoba, as well as shea butter. While it has no artificial fragrance, there's strong tea tree-like smell which I chalk up to the eucalyptus oil. This is okay and works fine in conjunction with a foaming second cleanse, but hardly a favorite."

This works but is underwhelming. It does have a slight eucalyptus smell but now strong. It is almost a medicinal eucalyptus scent but not terrible or overpowering. It did not react on my skin which is always great to find a product that doesn’t cause hives and rashes. I have an allergic reaction to Cetaphil if that puts it into perspective. While it does remove make up perfectly I didn’t absolutely love the feeling after I rinsed my face. It felt like there was still product on my face from the cleanser. Almost like a film. I am most certainly going to finish the container and if nothing else is available I would definitely re-purchase this but I didn’t love the feeling after I rinsed my face. BanilaCo rinses so well and doesn’t feel like product was left behind. It does melt beautifully on your skin, but that can be a problem with ordering during the summer. Since it would easily melt in the warm weather in transit. Overall a decent product!"

One of the things I love about this facial cleaner is how gentle it is on my skin. Despite being a scrub, it doesn't irritate or dry out my skin like some other exfoliating products do. Instead, it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.

The peeling gel works by breaking down dead skin cells and unclogging pores, leaving my skin looking brighter and more radiant. It has a lightweight, gel-like consistency that spreads easily and works well with my skin type.

I also appreciate that the COSRX Low pH Good Night Soft Peeling Gel is free from harsh chemicals and is suitable for all skin types. It's a great alternative to more abrasive scrubs that can be harsh on sensitive skin.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the COSRX Low pH Good Night Soft Peeling Gel and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to improve the appearance of their skin. It's an awesome product that leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed."

It has a *very* light, clean scent (if you smell the opening of the bottle), however, there is really no scent at all that I notice while using.
Again, not knowing what to expect, it felt weird the first time, because the cellulose feels like rubbing little wet pieces of paper around on your face, lol. Which I guess makes sense since cellulose and paper are both made from tree pulp.
This has a different sort of feel to it, as it isn't particularly ""slippery"" and kind of feels like you're just rubbing the little pieces of wet paper around on your face, as though there is no actual product, so it was tempting to keep adding more product. But don't do that, lol. It really is working, even if it feels like there's nothing there.
Although I have been careful to avoid the eye area, this seems quite gentle and I haven't experienced any type of burning or irritation at all.
The first time I used it, I did get a little on my lips by accident, but all it did was remove the dry, peeling skin, leaving them very soft& smooth. (Wouldn't recommend using this for that reason on purpose, as some people may have more sensitive lips/skin than I.)
At night, I pre-cleanse with COSRX LowPh Good Morning (tea tree oil) Cleanser, and then use this Low Ph Good Night Gel Cleanser. Since starting this, it has left my skin with a lovely glow, feeling very clean & refreshed.
On a side note, the first couple of times I used this product, I noticed that several of those teeny, tiny, hard round bumps under the surface of my skin, several that I didn't even know where there, (you know, those tiny, hard ""pearl""-like round bumps; the kind that are impossible to squeeze or remove without tearing up your skin) were RIGHT at the surface, almost all the way out by themselves, and easily came the rest of the way out, causing NO damage to my skin at all. It was very satisfying, lol.
I guess the product gently removed the dead layers that were keeping them trapped.
I've only been using this for perhaps a week or so, but it does seem that the pores on my nose and cheeks are just a bit smaller. They're certainly cleaner!
Before using this peel gel, I had suddenly begun breaking out far more (and worse) than usual, and since using this, I've had no new breakouts at all and it has helped to rapidly get rid of existing blemishes.
I REALLY love this stuff and will definitely continue to purchase and use this product!
Hope this helps a little if you're on the fence.
Highly recommend giving this a try!"

I can't get BHA (salicylic acid) or propylene glycols near my face because they cause contact dermatitis even at low concentrations.

It's moisturizing, although I feel like it leans more on the oily/greasy side. It also looks good on and evens out my lip color. I also like that it came with an applicator.

It's definitely NOT better than Laneige though, which I prefer because it's thicker and lasts way longer. I dislike how this feels on the lips, it's slippery but also somehow grainy. I also dislike the scent/taste of this, it's a faintly reminicent of cheese or evaporated milk?

I wanted to like this but I think I'll stick with my Laneige or maybe use it over a tinted (and scented!) lip balm occasionally."

I have purchased many CosRx products in the past and loved them all so I had high expectations.
I should have researched the ingredients (listed below) first before purchasing. I don't particularly care for both Shea butter and coconut oil which are both in this product.
It feels a lot like coconut oil but also is not very hydrating for me. When I first opened it there was a small pool of liquid oil in the center of the product that didn't look too appealing. However, with some of the natural ingredients that is going to happen and didn't really bother me.
There is no fragrance which is a big plus and no artificial color.
I also found that I have to use more product than with Laneige so the little container likely is not going to last as long.
I'll use this up but won't repurchase."

The consistency of this lip mask is much harder and oilier than it looks in the pictures. You really have to dig your finger in there in order to get out enough to cover your lips. It applies smoothly, albeit a bit thin and sticky (if you use too much, it feels strange on the lips rather than feeling like a thick mask). It also tastes like literally nothing. Like. Nothing. I've been trying to figure out a taste/scent of this product ever since I got it and it's nothing. Which is fine if you're sensitive to scents, but I'm not and I like my lip products to have a little bit of flavor.
When I wake up after using this mask overnight, my lips feel smoother but not necessarily hydrated. It's like it gives the surface some help but doesn't soak all the way through. My dry skin feels softer but it's not gone.
Overall, I probably would not order this lip mask again and would splurge the extra $5 to get my name brand alternative, but this is a fair dupe that works fine."

With this one, I put one on my jaw at night, and in morning I got the gross satisfaction of seeing a bunch of white stuff on the patch and an almost entirely clear part of my face.
My minor gripe is that pulling it off your face is a bit uncomfortable, but I'm guessing stretching out to the sides while pulling it off would help (like a compeed bandage)"

Not particularly for actually getting rid of the pimple - I have a lot of deep acne that doesn't lend itself really well to being suctioned out -but because I'm a picker and these things stop me from making everything 10 times worse!

Of all of the pimple patches I've tried, these are decent enough as far as actually getting the gunk out, but I love them because they are just so large and cover such a large area.

I will say, these work best over LONG periods of time, more than just a night. You're supposed to take them off once the edges kind of start to loosen on their own, which takes a decent chunk of time. I usually wear these on my weekends for a night and the next day, and sometimes even another night when I have no plans outside of the house - these are nowhere near as discreet as the smaller ones because they are just so big so I always feel a little self-conscious wearing them out for anything more involved than walking in and picking up a mobile order somewhere."

Since discovering hydrocolloid acne patches, I’ve been obsessively buying multiple brands and testing them to see which works best. As you can see from my photos and line of work, I’m prone to deep and superficial acne and “maskne” as well as hyperpigmentation. I’ve tried hanhoo and alba patches (available at Walmart) as well as a few others and this one by far worked the best.
I applied these patches before going to work and took them off once I got home (12hrs). After applying, I couldn’t even see where the borders were, but within a few hours, the pus and oil these drew out was shocking, and by the time I made it home I couldn’t believe it.
I had already previously treated several of these spots already with the patches from the other brands- they were already flat and non-sensitive. In my mind, “healed” minus some residual discoloration. Especially because no new drainage was collecting on the other patches.
Then I use this one and Boom! I was SHOCKED to see the amount these patches drew from my “healed” areas. Even areas where I “didn’t have acne” because my skin looked perfect on the outside.
These patches are huge so they’re great if you have focal/concentrated acne areas. As well as hitting areas you didn’t even know about that would soon be a problem. The other brands patches are just small, different sized circles- to get the same results you would have to apply like you’re a pixelated character. Trust and believe- I have😅😂
The middle patch was on my chin, the others on both cheeks. Forgot to snap what all three looked like before removal because I was too excited to see the results.
I even put moisturizer on my face around the patches after applying because I’m prone to dry skin- this didn’t affect them at all. Didn’t budge through me sweating during my 12 hour shift caring for patients. No lifting at the edges at all.
I even removed and reapplied the chin patch 3 times before leaving its placement- I need to be able to talk and really wanted to experiment with how it did after losing “initial adhesive” and being in a very mobile area of my face, so I pity placed it on my chin as a test. I didn’t even think any would come on that patch at all because of how “treated, flat, and un-inflamed” it was.. You can see the results in my photo. Stayed out all night. 10/10. Will be buying more and highly recommend!"

Always cleanse your face first because that’s when it works the best.

I had a painful pimple near a birthmark come up on Saturday morning, and I had just watched Khloe Kardashian speak about how she thought she had a pimple but it was actually melanoma so I was spiraling about this. So I decided to just make sure it wasn’t a pimple and put a patch over it since my dermatology office is closed on the weekend anyway. I washed my face with my shiseido cleanser, air dried my face and then applied a patch to my cheek. I left it on from around 7 PM Saturday evening until about 10 AM on Sunday morning and it extracted so much gunk. Now, it’s Monday and the surface is flat and it doesn’t hurt. It’s completely purged and the redness is starting to subside.

CosRx products just work everytime I use them. You just have to be patient and remember that there are no 5 minute cures. Skin takes time to purge, the heal and to show off the benefits. I highly recommend these. I always keep them on hand. Especially with my PCOS causing random pimples."

Cleaned the piercing, lay this flush with it, within 3 days the ungodly inflammation and leakage is almost gone and it's obviously healing this time.

I can't recommend these enough. Only thing is just make sure you clean around where you're going to use them with alcohol and don't apply any lotion around the area before or after applying them. The oils loosen it and it'll fall off. That's user error. Not a flaw in the product. Use it like you're supposed to and it'll work the way it's supposed to."

With the current sale and if you order them via subscribe and save you can get it down to ten bucks which is much more reasonable, but still a bit pricey.

I've found that these large patches work best on fully open acne spot rather than just slightly punctured ones. I had a section of large cystic acne on the back of my neck that I'd been battling for a month. When I finally just decided to dig into them and hope for the best I tried one of these after a few days of them not healing well. It seemed to work great. I left it on for 24 hours and it seems to absorb all or at least most of the gunk from all the really raw open ones.

On the other hand when I used it on a cluster of small punctured acne spots under my face mask, it didn't seem to do nearly as well.

This stuck really well for over 24 hours. So well in fact that I lost a few hairs from the back of my neck as well. It did help form a nice healing cover over the old acne as well.

These are expensive, and seem to work best on raw open acne, but I did like them and would consider purchasing them in the future, especially since I likely wouldn't have to use them often. I think If I needed this size often, I'd be more inclined to find something more cost effective."

I also really like them for covering a cut or a blister on my heel. These patches are a godsend and work so well compared to just putting a Band-Aid on something. They really do help healing without adding any thing in there. It's like the covering allows your skin to heal on its own better than it would uncovered.

These are essentially hydrocolloid pimple patches but larger, so that you can treat an area of concern or a group of blemishes with a single patch. They're contoured for a better fit. They're almost invisible on the skin and help to clear up blemishes while also keeping you from picking at them, which could lead to scarring.

Sometimes, they work and other times they don't work great. The effects of this pimple patch is just as good as the normal ones. The size/severness of the pimple gets reduced A LOT after a whole day (or night) of wearing it, especially if the white stuff is showing already. One night of use typically isn't enough. After a few days the pimples I've used these on are flat, less red and less likely to scar. I make sure to create a small hole in the actual acne before placing one on.

I should have looked more closely, but in case you didn’t—this is made with standard American chemical sunscreen ingredients like Octocrylene, Avobenzone, etc. Not the active ingredients that are usually in Korean brands (which aren’t FDA approved so you don’t find them in American chemical sunscreen, yet they are safer and healthier active ingredients).

I was gonna just not worry about it since it’s only one bottle—even if I’m concerned about the toxicity of those ingredients, one bottle won’t hurt. Except I cannot STAND the fragrance. It really sticks around on your face. It was so off-putting to me that it actually made me lose my appetite. Grandma-ish and just yucky. Had to wash it off.

I think I’ll have to just throw it away. Such a disappointment."

A common theme among all of them is their lightweight feel. Better put: they dont feel like susncreens, they just feel like nice lightweight moisturizers, which is what I love about them. This feel is made possible because asian brands have a lot of freedom with sun filter formlations (not possible in the US because of FDA regulations). Anyway, it turns out that cosrx took the time to have this specific sunscreen fda approved, which is why the list of ingredients resembles that of US sunscreens a whole lot. I only realized this after trying it on for the first time because, contrary to the other reviews, it is very greasy and heavy. Now, my definition of greasy and heavy is based on the time it takes to absorb into the skin, and how it feels after. It will take a good minute to fully blend this into the skin and you'll definitely feel it on your skin for a good hour after application. It WILL feel like a sunscreen. It reminded me a lot of la roche posay and banana boat sunscreens (yes I consider those heavy and greasy). To be completely fair though, I am a little spoiled by asian sunscreens, so, if youre used to how US sunscreens feel, you'll be fine with this. In summary, don't buy this sunscreen if you're looking for a typical lightweight asian sunscreen."

It was very well reviewed no matter where I looked. It is supposed to be good for sensitive skin. It is supposed to give a ""glow.""

It seemed to function as a sunscreen so that's why it got 3 stars.

I took 2 stars away because this lotion goes on thick and geasy. It doesn't really get any less greasy as it sits on the skin. It feels like my skin is covered with a heavy grease all day.

It says it supposed to make your skin ""glow."" It sort of does if you think ""glow"" is supposed to be incredibly shiny. I wasn't impressed with how it made my skin look.

I suppose this would be good if you have skin as dry as the Sahara. If you don't, it will sit on your skin, feel heavy, feel greasy, and feel like it has sealed all your pores.

I am so disappointed. I wanted to like it."

I'm from Hawai'i so the smell of sunscreen typically reminds me of tourists, but this sunscreen is not only reef friendly but smells pleasant, almost like the smell of Bio Oil. It also has absolutely no white cast, NONE. I was in so much shock, it's better than La Roche or Cerave. I'm an olive colored, mixed Blasian woman and the minute it hits your skin it just melts. For some it may seem like it's greasy, but it's perfect for me, it gives that Korean glass skin look. There is also no piling, I noticed with Cerave sometimes it would pile or leave white clumps on the edge of my face, this does not. I also do not experience any eye burning, which is nice. The only reason you would experience this is if you applied it directly over your eye lids or near your eyes which they advise not to do. My only complaint is that it is not water proof so if you plan on utilizing this during excessive sweating or any type of ""wet"" activities lol do not expect this to do it's job. That is also stated in the product description."

It's long-lasting and very reliable (I swear it's why my skin looks pretty good at age 40) but its very matte, and leaves a white cast. I switched to this stuff for the fall/ winter but today I went out biking with it on, no sun hat, and I'm not sure it protects as well as the Sheiseido stuff does. It's also a little greasy. THAT being said, applying makeup over it is MUCH easier. It's pretty hard to get an even application over the Sheiseido stuff.

The smell was absolutely disgusting, but I was prepared for that having read the reviews. I had no negative skin reactions. A couple of hours later I started to get a headache. I took some ibuprofen, put the heating pad on my head, and went to sleep. I woke up at 3am with a terrible headache and I felt nauseous. I want to note that I get frequent migraines and that this was not a migraine headache. It was a painful tightness all around the top of my head. Also, I realized that the heat from the heating pad was reactivating the smell of the serum on my face, which was really gross. When I finally tried to get up and move around at 7am it was awful. I felt like I had the stomach flu. Sweating, shaking, nauseous. And then I threw up. I really did think I was sick and didn’t even consider the serum until a few hours later. I talked to my sister and mentioned my thoughts about the serum. She suggested that I take a long hot shower to try and get it all off of me and to change my bedding. So I did, and by the end of Saturday I was feeling not 100% but so much better. I haven’t seen any other reviews that mention this type of reaction. I tried googling it too and found nothing, so obviously this could be some kind of weird coincidence that I got sick for a short time while trying to use this product. Either way, I’m too scared to try it again. The smell alone might make me sick anyway. Good luck!"

This serum tore my skin up! Before I started using it my skin was blemish free, I just needed something to close my pores and make my skin look even. I really regret using this and will never have a skin care routine again. I have combination oily skin. I used it at morning and night, after 4 days the right side of my face started getting itchy and red, the left side grew 3 puss filled bumps and then my face was sooooo dry all together. There’s no scent and the serum has a nice smooth feel to it which made me feel like my face was going to look like pretty glass, but boy was I wrong."

I have used this product for a long time, and know it’s suppose to have a thicker viscosity and it absorbs almost instantly into the skin. I knew immediately something was wrong when the droplet immediately ran down my skin. I am not sure who is at fault here- cosrx for a possible defective batch or someone in the fulfillment center is tampering with cosrx products. I even double checked whether the product came from a third party or cosrx- supposedly it came directly from the company. I’m not too happy because I have no clue what I just placed on my skin- could have been toilet water for all I know. Gross. Please, for anyone new to using this product- squeeze one droplet and if it rolls off your skin like water it’s tampered or defective- Do not use!"

This product itself is fine, but it didn't even last 30 days I purchased this during black Friday recieved on the 23rd of Nov. Now it is Dec. 18th, and this bottle is completely empty. I used 2-3 drops a every evening and maybe also 2-3 drop 3-4 mornings a week. Honestly it's insane that this didn't even last a month for a product with a $25 price tag. I would rate these ingredients a step above a drug store brand, yet far more pricey. Which makes the misleading packaging a huge disappointment to say the least.

I would be happy with a 5-10% niacinamide serum with more quantity in the bottle, since the research on the use of niacinamide is based on a 5% concentration. This feels like a major money grab in my opinion. Want my money back. Will not be purchasing again. Will go with mad hippie or good molecules instead because they offer quality and fair quantity for the price"

It is definitely what I would consider one of my holy grail products for skincare and anti aging. My complexion looks brighter and more even, which is exactly what I was hoping for. The serum feels lightweight and absorbs quickly, making it easy to incorporate into my routine.

The only slight downside I’ve experienced is a bit of peeling if I use it daily, but it’s not painful or overly noticeable. My skin is pretty sensitive, so this might just be my personal reaction. Those with less sensitive skin may not have this issue at all. Overall, I think it’s an excellent serum, especially if you’re looking for a brighter, more even complexion."

Best I’ve found so far with dealing with the bumps."

My skin does okay with it but there is a little stinging.

This will be one Cosrx product I likely won't reorder. I instead use Beauty of Joseon's niacinamide with propolis--it doesn't irritate my skin and it feels wonderful going on.

Also, this is less than an ounce and my BOJ is 1.01 ounces and costs less. Though, Cosrx is not pricey at all - very reasonable prices. If it didn't sting my face, I'd probably reorder to use alternate days with BOJ."

After diligently using this product for several months as directed, including following up with moisturizer and consistent sun protection, I can confidently say it failed to deliver on its promises.

2. Overhyped and Overrated
COSRX as a brand has been hyped up, but this serum proved to be a massive disappointment. The fleeting sense of anti-aging benefits was barely noticeable, and certainly not worth the investment.

3. A Waste of Money and Time
Considering the price and the time spent waiting for results that never came, I regret purchasing this serum. The cost is unjustified, and the “benefits” are nonexistent.

4. Better Alternatives Exist
I would highly recommend exploring products from Beauty of Joseon instead. Their formulations offer far better results without the frustration or wasted effort.

5. Final Verdict
Never again will I buy into the COSRX hype. This serum was a letdown in every sense—save your money and try a brand that actually delivers.

Would not repurchase or recommend."

I top it off in the morning with a light moisturizer followed by sunblock. This review is based on that usage.

The pros:
- I have no pilling with this product. I have used The Ordinary hyaluronic acid and found that it causes pretty distressing levels of pilling. See above, I layer my products. Alone, other products may not pill. If you layer, this is a good option.
- No odor. I have purchased other products from other brands that have a pleasant odor. I like that this brand is unscented, but as we all know, being unscented and having no odor are two different things. Gasoline doesn't have fragrance added, but it's stinky. This product has no odor, either when applying or when dry.
- Effective. I haven't taken photos to know how effective this is day to day. I always use it, my face is getting older (it is what it is) and I think I'm holding up pretty well. I will say, if I don't put it on right after my morning shower, I feel the difference. I feel dryer, and my skin is less ""springy"".
- Pretty container. This might not be a pro to someone else, but if you have a little display for your lotions and potions, this looks nice on display.

Cons:
- It is costlier than other brands, but not prohibitively.
- The container is a weird shape. It's also black. It is not possible to know how much you have left, and it's hard to get the last drop.

Overall, I have bought this a few times and will be buying it again."

I am a little disappointed in COSRX for not being completely transparent about that. I really had to search to find the amount. I adore COXRX skincare as my skin absolutely loves it, but this is where they drop the ball. That out of the way ---

The serum is beautiful. It's medium thick clear. Glides on my skin so smoothly. Very hydrating. I pair this with the COSRX snail mucin - it took me a long time to order snail mucin as it is a little gross and I make sure to avoid my lips (ew), but the two together calm down my rosacea redness--I have Type 1, which is redness and flushing - stinging if my barrier is compromised.

This has Sodium Hyaluronate, which is the better hyaluronate as far as it has a smaller 'molecule size' so it can penetrate better--at least this is what I understand.

The fourth ingredient is glycerin, which is very hydrating, and adds a lot to the formulation.

I put this on damp skin, and whether I use the snail mucin first, second, or not at all, after applying on damp skin I dampen a makeup sponge or use damp fingers to pat and press more moisture into my skin. I let that 'sink in' for a while - 3-5 minutes or sometimes longer before going on with my skincare.

Sometimes my cheeks will be red and this along with the mucin will immediately calm it down - well, immediately as in about 30 seconds or so after applying. Even the act of applying skincare can make my cheeks turn red.

I love that COSRX is not expensive at all - even at less than an ounce, it's still a bargain. This along with Beauty of Joseon are my two favorite K-Beauty brands and I don't use much of anything else anymore."

Ladies, look no further for your new retinol bestie. Scentless, moisturizing repairs and dryness and leaves smooth skin behind.

However, after using the Retinol Oil, my skin started acting up. I experienced irritation and breakouts, so I had to stop using it entirely. I understand that retinol can be tricky for sensitive skin, but even after trying to introduce it gradually, it just didn’t agree with me.

It’s a bummer because I wanted this to be a staple in my routine, but it ended up being a miss. That said, COSRX still has some amazing products that I’ll continue using, just not this one. If you have very sensitive skin, you might want to patch test thoroughly before committing to it."

I have age 50+ mature, dry, sensitive skin. A lot of retinol products end up burning my eyes or flaking my skin, they have a weird texture, smell bad, or just don’t work. This is like liquid gold. It’s in oil form. I put it on about an hour before I go to bed so it has a chance to absorb. I eliminated all other serums at night. Now I just use this after I cleanse my face. It’s all I need. My sagging chin has lifted and my skin is much more even and smooth. I didn’t have a lot of wrinkles for my age, but it’s smoothed the crow’s feet around my eyes. I’m on my 3rd bottle. I saw a difference after only about a few weeks. It’s amazing stuff!"

I never had any skin irritation or any issues when applying it in my regular skincare routine. However it's advised not to use retinol every day or when scrubbing your face. It's very lightweight and your skin is able to absorb it nicely so it won't leave your face oily. I noticed that if you don't keep it in the fridge that the color of the serum may change to a darker color due to oxidation so best to keep it in a regular fridge.

The picture with my earring is after and the picture that is brighter is before. It’s not a huge difference but I’ve only used it twice (along with my other skincare) and can see a difference not only in pictures but in person. Also, the instructions say to use it only a few days a week as it may cause irritation and I did do a day break in between the two uses and did not experience any irritation at all.

I only use as needed probably less than once a week. but i especially like to use it when i notice my skin becoming congested/break out starting and during the winter since we’re not in the sun as often so it’s safer. Literally by the next morning, it seems to stop breakout in its tracks. I see some reviews had some bad eye reactions and I just want to say be careful with using retinol in the under eye area. You “can” but you probably want to avoid it, the under eye skin area is very delicate and much thinner than the rest of our face. In fact you will find most retinol products telling you to avoid the eye area on the package…unless it’s sold as an eye cream. Just a tip!
And if you’re peeling a lot from this, you’re probably using it too often and or not moisturizing enough. Like I said I only use this once every other week, which is to avoid irritation/peeling. Also, I noticed the info says you can use this in the day with spf, which is surprising because dermatologists would tell you to only use retinol before bed at night. This is because it is both safer (retinol makes your skin sensitive to uv rays) and just convenient (your skin “heals” overnight, working alongside the retinol). Also, not to invalidate some of the ladies who shared their photos of their reactions but if you have very smooth skin, hardly visible pores with no signs whatsoever of aging and you’re not prone to breakouts, you really don’t need to use retinol and probably shouldn’t because it can damage the skin barrier with long term use or if you don’t moisturize enough, so ladies who CAN benefit from retinol are using it because the reward of that is greater than the risk of the skin barrier issue…no offense but I do think people should read about these “heavier” chemical skincare treatments before just buying… But luckily this product is a much gentler version of prescribed retinol. I really love this product in moderation. Just one use at night and the next morning I definitely notice a difference! Thanks for reading :)"

I actually really liked it. The texture is nice, light but hydrating. It is good quality & didn't leave a sticky residue. It seemed to hydrate my dry skin pretty well. CosRX is a great brand & i use other products of theirs. I only got to use this 3 times though, bc apparently I am allergic to snail mucin! After the 3rd day I started getting hives. I had to discontinue use and ended up giving it to my mom, who didn't have a reaction and loves it. I got it on sale for 8$ so it wasn't like i was out a bunch of money. Btw the bottle is HUGE. Itll last a while.
Apparently, a lot of people are allergic to snail mucin, so always do a patch test before putting it on your face (as with any product)!! I give it 4 stars bc it is a good product, but beware of the allergy potential. I know it says to patch test first, and it's my fault for not doing that, but i wish they would tell people about the potential and frequency of snail mucin allergies. Yes, I have Google, so again more my fault than theirs, but i just want companies to be more transparent."

Within a week I saw pretty noticeable changes. Considering the price, I am extremely impressed with how effective this product has been. My skin is just so glowy and supple.

I was a little worried because some people posted that they had reactions, but fortunately, I did not have any reactions. I've been using it for a few weeks now and my skin is so clear! And not only that, since it was so inexpensive, I put some on my lower legs, ankle area because it gets so itchy from dryness and the tube was a lot bigger than I'd expected. Well, now my calves are baby smooth! Now I'm slathering it everywhere! lol. I'm here to get another tube before the price goes back up.

I stopped after a day and went back to coconut oil and olive oil. My skin is recovering, but sadly I am still searching for the right product for me. 0/10 stars, absolutely would not recommend!"

Honestly I was expecting a small package since it’s a Korean product (thy can be too small for the price asked). So I ordered two during the Black Friday sale. I was so shocked at the size of the product that now I’m wondering what should I do with the second one (hahaha).

Anyways starting the product is sticky and it feels like I’m dabbing a huge sticky blob on my face. But it gets immediately absorbed and my face feels moisturised. As I have a combination skin (dry in winter and oily in summer) I feel this is a good product. I use the cream before sleeping and when I wake up, I check to see if any stains are there on my silk pillowcase (None thank god) and when I wash my face, it washes off well. This means that the product was absorbed well and it adds a nice moisture layer that is required.

I still have to try it in summer but when it’s oily skin season but for now it’s a great product for all those people who cannot decide which product is good for them or who have multiple seasonal creams."

I always read reviews and a majority of the time I'm not getting results like most. This is the secret!!!! My fine lines are almost gone, skin is glowing, even redness which I have always had no matter what has calmed down. I use this every morning and night, will never stop using this. To explain how it just goes on so silky and smooth, then my skin just drinks it up and sighs in relief is not doing it justice. Tip, make sure skin is moist with toner or essence, or even water, just make sure it's moist before using snail mucin. Leftover in mask packaging can be used on neck, decolletage, and HANDS, game changer for my dry AF hands."

It almost smells like fish oil but luckily the smell goes away as soon as it settles into your skin so thank goodness for that lol. It does have a sticky feel to it which made me think it would do well as a foundation primer. It worked real well but again, if you do, just make sure you powder your face or you’ll be looking extra shiny all day long lol.

It smells like teatree oil i do not know if thats in it but thats the closest description of the smell I am familiar with.
It leaves my skin soft and not tight feeling. I use it every night and every other morning.. although it does irritate my skin if I use it twice EVERYDAY so I alternate my morning face wash with a different mild cleanser.
The pm peel does work. People say it pills in your hand and yes it can. My facial girl told me dab it on your face then rub. I was skeptical at first that the product was what was pilling so I used it, washed it off, and used it again and it didn't pill the second time immediately after washing it off so contrary to other reviews it is not just the product pilling. I use it 3 days a week and have noticed my face looks less congested and cleaner.
I did have to stop using my curology prescription though because it was burning if used together so be mindful what other products you are using.
I do recommend this as it has helped me alot however it probably isn't the BEST for sensitive skin."

I kept reapplying the lotions to see if it would help (winter in Wisconsin and all, ok maybe I needed a little more to get going). Wrong! By the end of the first day, my PD was flaring up, when it had been dormant for a bit. I was getting the red, burning dry spots to either side of my mouth and a red patch under my left eye. I stopped after a day and went back to coconut oil and olive oil. My skin is recovering, but sadly I am still searching for the right product for me. 0/10 stars, absolutely would not recommend!"

I’ll admit, I was skeptical about putting snail slime on my face. But after just one use, I’m ready to personally thank every snail involved in this masterpiece. My skin is so smooth and reflective that I’m basically a walking highlighter now—no makeup required.

When they said “glass skin,” I thought, “Okay, marketing hype.” NOPE. After one application, my pores disappeared like they had a scheduled PTO. I can practically see my future in my reflection, and spoiler alert: it’s hydrated and radiant.

The texture? A little slimy (obviously), but who cares when the results are this good? My skin feels bouncier than a brand-new mattress, and the glow? Oh, honey, the glow is so real that a stranger asked me if I drink 12 glasses of water a day. I told them, “Nope, just snail magic!”

If you’re on the fence, jump off, run to this product, and prepare for your face to look like it was kissed by angels (and snails). Five stars? More like infinity stars. Highly recommend!"

I'm 36 and a few years back found out I have not only sensitive skin but also Seborrheic Dermititis on my scalp and face. I've been trying to find something that won't dry out my skin and something that won't be so oily my face freaks out. I know some k-beauty and K-beauty makeups I've tried are very good and don't freak out my skin so I thought you know what let's try this! I use a biore sensitive face cleanser and a toner afterwards and let my face calm down for a minute or two. Then I dampen my face a little with water and use one pump of the snail extract on my face and neck, I rub abd tap it in until I cant feel it. At night I do the same but every other night I use a little of the retinol cream on the middle of my face and where I have blackheads, wrinkles and pimples rub it in and then apply the snail extract. This stuff works and I've had bumpy, scaly, huge pores most of my life and it will take some time and even ny friends at work are noticing my face isnt as red and scaly and I have less dry skin in 4 weeks.

Guys I love this stuff. I’m one of those people that can’t tolerate oil cleansers for double cleansing, so this is the only thing that works!!

I squirt a healthy portion of this onto a soft microfiber cloth and wipe my face down, and I can double duty and do it while I'm doing my 60 second mouthwash. It's a lovely one-step cleanse and tone for those days you can't be bothered. Slap on some moisturizer after and I'm ready for bed in about 5 minutes flat including brushing teeth.

I love THIS micellar water over others because of the Niacinamide and the beautiful viscosity of the water. It really has a great amount of surface tension that puts it ahead of the game as far as micellar waters go. It's worth it. Get it. You won't regret."

Truly amazing. Gives that soft glow, like a full glass skin moment every time. Skin feels plumped up and soft. Apparently it helps the next serums you apply work better, too! Idk about that, but whatever it’s doing for my skin is great. The bottle is pretty large, too, and the packaging says you can layer it more for additional hydration…I did that tonight after steaming my face after a clay mask and I’m even more thrilled. It’s pretty excited to look in the mirror and think, “wow, pretty!” when it comes to your skin. And this definitely makes me think that, more and more as I use it."

First and foremost, the plumping effect is incredible. My skin feels noticeably firmer and smoother, giving it a youthful, radiant glow. The hydration it provides is top-notch—my skin stays moisturized all day without feeling heavy or greasy. It layers beautifully under makeup and other skincare products, making it versatile for both day and night use.

On top of all that, the price is fantastic for the quality you’re getting. It’s rare to find a product this effective without breaking the bank.

Overall, I can’t recommend the COSRX 6X Peptide Collagen Booster Toner Serum enough. It’s a game-changer, and I’ll definitely be repurchasing!"

I have normal-combination skin, and I've been working on improving my skin's moisture barrier as well as the overall effectiveness of other products I use. It comes in a clear bottle with a pump that dispenses just the right amount to cover the entire face. I typically use 1-2 pumps as the first step after cleansing. Its water-like texture absorbs instantly, prepping my skin for products like snail essence, serums, and moisturizers. The lightweight, non-sticky formula boosts overall skin health, addressing pores, firmness, fine lines, and more.

I'm particularly impressed with how this serum improves absorption and creates a smooth, soft complexion. COSRX consistently delivers high-quality, effective products at affordable prices, and this serum is no exception. K-beauty has earned its stellar reputation for a reason! I pretty much plan to keep this product in my daily routine forever. For anyone looking to enhance their skin condition, this serum is legit!"

It has a viscosity that is more gel like which makes it easier to apply and also clings to the skin better than The Ordinary's. If you are looking for an effective peel that is easier to apply and not quite as harsh try this! I have never tried a Cosrx product I didn't like. I woke up with smooth glowing skin after using this last night. I left it on ten minutes and followed up with a moisturizing mask. If you are older or have sensitive skin this may be the peel for you.

It is too mild for me. A little tingling for a few seconds on my 1st use. I followed the directions and washed it down 10 minutes later. A week later, I used it for the 2nd time. I didn't feel any tingling and was able to let it sit on my face and neck for over 45 minutes. I don't see/feel any significant result. I will probably give the rest of the tube to a friend.

I’ve been pretty happy with them all! I started with the essence serum. LOVE IT! Get it and use it twice a day. Then I ordered the .01 retinol. Together, fantastic! Your skin may get dry and start to peel slightly after some use. I just lay off the retinol when that happens. I ended up ordering the retinol serum next to up the retinol. You have to keep it in the fridge. I don’t know if I’ve noticed that much change with that one but something must be happening because my sister in law complimented my skin. So I ordered the overnight rice mask. I like that one. I love how my skin feels in the morning! I don’t wash my face with soap in the morning, I just rinse with water then use the essence before I put my moisturizer and makeup on. I saw this peel because I feel like I needed a boost. Light tingles, nothing bad. Rinsed off with water after 10 min. Omg LOVE the feeling of my skin after!
Last night I used it for the second time. I left mine on a little longer than 10 minutes ( I’ve been doing peels a long time) and it felt great! No irritation or burning at all. You know your skin so listen to your skin. If you can’t do the full 10 minutes then take it off. You can always build up to it. Skincare is definitely not a one size fits all. So don’t try to be a champ. Do what you can and listen to your skin!

I will also state after I started using the essence and seeing results I ended up ordering the 7 light therapy hand held device. That completely took my skincare to the next level! I have seen a huge difference in the texture, hyperpigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles. I usually use the light with my essence serum just fyi. I’m going to try the eye gel next I think."

I've used this product a few times since with the same results. It makes me a bit nervous that I may be allergic to something in it, but there are no lasting side effects, so who knows? Maybe that's how it's supposed to feel.

With the application, it is quite easy to rub all over your face, and it is nice and thin so your skin doesn't feel heavy and gross with it on. It also easily washes off. I feel nice and clean afterwards, so I assume it's doing what it needs to do. I really do not like the chemical smell, however."

It’s gentle and doesn’t feel our skin feeling dry or incredibly sensitive after. In front of a magnifying mirror it’s also easy to apply since it has color and you can see where you’ve applied it. The sensation after washing it off after the suggest 10 minutes is a refreshing feeling. It does dry rather quickly so it does require a bit more gentle action with a face towel and warm water to remove, but I can’t really say taking a bit more effort to do this is some great negative."

This wasn't intimidating for me to use. It didn't cause any skin discomfort. I love that it has color to it because it makes the application process much quicker since it's so easy to see where you have applied. I have been slowly increasing the time - I started at 4 and worked my way up to 6 mins. Tubes are small, so you won't get a ton of use out of them. I use the compressed facial sponges to help remove it in the shower after I'm done.

No irritation and some texture improvement. I can't use very regularly right now because I finally started regularly doing at home IPL on my facial hair, but I plan to add it back into my routine because even in a few short uses I have noticed some texture improvement."

However, I have found their instructions on the box to be very straightforward and easy to follow. The most important thing to remember is to put on sunscreen during the day after you use this product.

This is a very strong product! Immediately after my first time using this, my skin felt SOOO much softer! I am impressed by how smooth my skin was and to my surprise, my skin wasn't irritated from it. When I first put on the product, my skin does sting quite a bit but the stinging does end up going away after a minute or two. If the stinging does not go away for you, it could mean that you might be allergic to the product.

You do have to work quite fast when you are applying the product as it dries pretty fast. I would recommend working on one area of your face at a time. When it dries, it becomes a bit sticky and if you touch your face with sticky dried product on your finger, it removes some of the product from your face. The only way to try to apply an even application after it has dried is to add more product to your fingers to smear onto your face. The product itself does not have a pleasant smell. It smells very acidic and reminds me of vinegar. While the name of the product does have the word ""peel"" in it, I was under the impression that this would be a peel off mask. However, turns out it's an chemical exfoliant so what it means by peel is that it peels away at dead skin cells.

Given it's a chemical exfoliant, I do err on the side of caution and wash off the product at the 8 minute mark despite the box suggesting 10 minutes. I figured that it takes me 1-2 minutes applying the product to my face so some parts of my face might've gotten longer exposure to the product. When I do wash it off, I make sure to wash it off thoroughly and wipe down with a toner to make sure all of the residual acid has been washed off of my face.

Another tip is that if you have tattooed or micro-bladed eyebrows, I would recommend that you try to keep this product away from your eyebrows as it could speed up the fading of the tattoo as it's exfoliating the top layer of your skin.

Overall, this is a nice product that helps me achieve very glowy and smooth skin. Although the box warns against using on sensitive skin, my experience was fine and it didn't dry out or irritate my skin. Make sure you follow the instructions to a T and not use this product more than once a week AND make sure to put on sunscreen in the daytime. Through using this product for a couple of weeks, I have noticed my overall skin condition has improved as I have less clogged pores and less acne now. Excited to continue using this product!"

I've used it twice now, spaced a week apart, on clean dry skin as per instructions.

The red color makes it easy to apply thoroughly, and to ensure you've completely rinsed it off afterwards. The first time I only left it on for 5 minutes as I wanted to make sure it didn't cause a reaction. I did feel some tingles at first, but it subsided before I had even finished applying the mask. The second time I left the mask on for closer to 9 minutes. Same thing, a little tingling at first but it quickly subsided. I used a good moisturizer after rinsing off and haven't had any issues with peeling or dryness/flakiness.

It takes some time to see products work on your skin like this. I do feel after 2 uses that the pores on my nose, my biggest problem spot, show some *very* slight improvement. Between that and the lack of irritation, and this little tube looking like it's gonna last a lot longer than I'd initially thought, I'm going to give 5 stars."

So was eager to try out this COSRX AHA BHA PHA LHA 35% Peel!

I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions. I have only been using on my cheeks, as that’s where I have enlarged pores. They recommend leaving on no longer than 10 minutes, I have only kept it on for 4-5 minutes and my skin has done well with that timeframe!

I’m shocked at this stuff! When I say NOTHING helps my pores, I mean NOTHING helps my pores! But THIS helps shrink my pores!!! I mean, I can still see them, but there is definitely a noticeable difference with just using a few times! So I know with continued use, I will see even a bigger improvement!

There are some great ingredients in this such as AHA BHA PHA LHA + Vitamin Trio + Hyaluronic Acid.

There are a few things to be careful of while using this. They suggest you avoid using with Vitamin C, Retinol, or Niacinamide-based products. ALSO, make sure to wear an SPF!! They also say to limit use to ONCE a week!

I love this stuff!! Another winner from COSRX! Definitely recommend and definitely will be ordering again!"

I decided to target treat areas, and did my nose, cheeks and chin. These are my worst areas, and the ones I know will benefit the most.

Listing page:
""Can this be used on sensitive skin? Based on a clinical test on 20-60 men and women between 20-60 years old, the AHA BHA PHA LHA 35 Peeling Gel is safe to use on sensitive skin.""

Back of product:
""We recommend use only if you are an experienced user of acid exfoliation and your skin is not sensitive.""

This contradictory information made me very hesitant to try the product. I ended up doing two patch tests on the inside of my elbow and on my wrist. I did not have any reaction so decided to try on my face. I used it for only five minutes and got visibly red on my forehead and cheeks and experienced a burning sensation.

It started to itch/pinprick a bit, mostly on my cheeks but it didn't last long.

Like I said I only left it on for 2 or 3 minutes and then thoroughly washed it off with water.
My pores were significantly smaller and my skin just looked clean and matte finally! I am sooooo impressed with how my skin turned out.
There has been no peeling or redness or anything as of the next day either, however I did follow up with a hydrating hyaluronic acid serum after this, so I would suggest moisturizing with a non pore clogging Moisturizer.

Very very pleased with this!
I wish there was more in the tube. I will likely leave it on for a minute or two longer next time to see how my skin responds.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"

I had high expectations since I've used this brand's other products before and loved them.

I normally have oily skin and sensitive skin. Sometimes my skin gets a little dry since I use differin (retinoid). We just turned the heat on recently and didn't start using our humidifiers yet - so this week my skin was a little dryer than usual. Because my skin was dryer I stopped using differin two days before using this and three days after.

I normally wash my face with a gentle cleanser twice a day and use differn at night. I only use a moisturizer if my skin is dry to begin with. So the only part of my ""beauty routine"" that I changed was stopping the differin.

This felt nice going on and a few days later my skin feels a little on the dry side/tight but looks better and feels smoother! There was no strong smell. Hoping after using for a few weeks I have more noticeably cleared pores (peels speed up the skin turn over rate but it's still going to take a few weeks to see full results realistically). I'm just happy that my face didn't peel off or feel like it was on fire like other peels I've tried.

Only complaint is the small tube size."

The skin underneath is untouched and so new that it looks so amazing naturally but if you want to show that new skin, this product is a great way of doing that. It’s a mild formulation and does the job it’s supposed to do effectively. You will notice a difference especially if this is one step you skip or never do.

It leaves my skin hydrated, balanced and feeling healthy.
I don't get the over-tight, dried out feeling that other cleansers give me.
After a week of use, I've noticed the small bumps on my forehead and jawline (from my skin being too dry) have gone away almost entirely.
The cleanser has no added fragrance, but it does have a moderate chemical odor from its ingredients."

Plenty to last you for a good, long time. Even for frequent face washers. It seems to be fairly clean and gentle enough on the skin. Cleans well and will help remove excess sebum without causing the skin to clog up.

It does leave my mature combination skin a tad bit dry feeling, but that's easily rectifiable with the addition of my regular skincare regimen. I do like this when I'm feeling extra oily, especially after a spell of using too many heavily rich emollient ladened skincare products. Most likely though, I will give this to a teenaged family member so they can be assured they are cleaning with a good facial cleanser for their skin type. This feels like something that would be especially good for those with oily and problematic skin. Fine also for those with normal skin, though I would highly suggest to follow up with a suitable serum and moisturizer. Good for both men and women alike, and especially good for teenagers."

It cleans off the sweat and dust that accumulate on my face while cycling. After using this product, my skin feels stripped of natural oils so I now follow it with an oil cleanser. My skin type is dry & sensitive so too much stripping of natural oil increases sensitivity to the point of anything I apply on my face will sting. For this reason, I only use it on days when my face is very dirty.

This would probably be a good cleanser for skin types other than sensitive."

It's not that I don't love the final results (clear skin without acne, reduction in wrinkles, etc); it's getting to the end of those initial side effects that give us a rollercoaster of a relationship. If I haven't used any in a while, my skin will be oozing oil so badly that ExxonMobil will be knocking at my door. 😆

I've been using retinol for a long time on most of my face; I even double up in troubled acne breakout areas and use retinol AND adapalene, but I've been terrified of using any retinoids in my under eye areas and on my neck, because I've tried many before, and they irritated the heck out of my neck and dried out my under eye areas.

Retinoids can be drying and can burn in these sensitive areas. On me, it tends to happen in a matter of hours. But this one didn't! It is silky, unlike the adapalene gel I use, and seemed to absorb right in - unlike ANY of the retinol and tretinoin formulations I've tried. I am kind of astonished that other companies, knowing what the purge can do, haven't made their retinol products this way, because this is the *chef's kiss* PERFECT texture. I took a chance using theirs in particular because I love all of this company's other products that I've tried (their 6 peptide booster, moisturizer, and peptide under eye serum). They are ALL so silky and luxurious. You would think you were using luxury brands, except you can still afford to pay bills! lol

I also love how they were thoughtful enough to put a warning on the tube in case someone squeezed it too hard before puncturing the top (you know what I mean: when you open a metal tube and the product comes flying out, and you can't get the cap back on fast enough). That in itself is reason to appreciate this company, because they DON'T want you to waste your money.

I don't know how this product will work long term, but I'm definitely going to find out! I'll be back to edit if there are any issues, but between the low cost, effectiveness of the ingredients, and the fact that I LOVE their other products, I am hopeful and I'm glad I took a chance on it!"

I used it for about two weeks and started to notice changes in my skin. I have combo skin with an oily T zone but after using this my skin started drying out tremendously and I noticed small red bumps but nothing too alarming. I also ordered the moisturizer with this set and loved how it would go on but after an hour my skin would feel dry, tight and uncomfortable. I did a Google search trying to find out if other people were developing similar symptoms and much to my surprise found that the dryness I was experiencing was more than the product not working. IT WAS AN ALLERGIC REACTION. The search also revealed that people who have dust mite allergies, me, shuld not use this product. It would have been nice if there was mention of this beforehand and definitely something the company should disclose.

I came across this product after researching a lot! I would say within 2 weeks I noticed a huge difference immediately! My pores on my nose can’t even see anymore. My face looks really nice, feels great! There was a little burn when I used it the first 2-3 times, but not anymore. Probably because my pores are much smaller. I love this stuff, the best I have ever used. I am actually going to buy some for Christmas gifts. I also use this two times a day after I was my face. The only thing I wish the bottle would list the ingredients and it shows nothing. I would love to know what is in it, just to compare why this is the only stuff out of dozens of other products that actually work. Also, the price is very affordable. They will have it on sale too!"

I followed the seller's suggestion to use the toner directly after cleansing and applied a few pumps of the peptide toner to my face using my fingers. I let that soak in for a minute and then applied a few drops of the niacinamide serum, again using my fingers to pat it into my skin. I followed up with my normal moisturizer. I prefer to do this routine in the evening, so that I can let my skin have time to absorb everything without worrying about my makeup getting icky.

The peptide toner has a lot of great ingredients that can help reduce redness (which is a big issue that I have), give skin a more plump look and help make your skin look more nourished.

The peptide toner/serum is meant to be used after cleansing, and it can be used as one layer or even applied again for multiple layers. The peptides in this are listed high enough in the ingredient list that there is likely enough to genuinely improve skin, although note that improvement takes consistent usage over tiime. This has the famous Botox-in-the-bottle peptide, and while that name is aspirational, over time, it is thought to seriously improve hydration which in turn improves the appearance of wrinkles. The other various peptides have anti-oxidant properties, soothe inflammation, improve skin texture and strength, brighten skin, and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzylamide diacetate probably has the least research backing it (it's all funded by the manufacturer), but overall, this is a great combo of peptides. This also has additional hydrating ingredients that help the skin barrier. Yuka 86/100 = excellent.

The niacinamide serum is also great for skin. Niacinamide brightens skin, improves collagen production, and improves the skin barrier. It's also helpful for some inflammatory conditions. Yuka 100/100 = excellent.

This serum has more niacinamide than many products, and while the vast majority of people will tolerate this concentration used as directed, anecdotally, some experience redness. Some temporary redness is not a problem (think of the niacin flush), but if the redness lingers or develops over time, you might want to use less, perhaps one drop mixed with a pump of the toner so you can spread it evenly. Usually, other ingredients are actually the problems for sustained redness, but anecdotally, some are more sensitive to niacinamide than others.

I have fairly reactive skin, and both of these products work great for me. They absorb quickly and neither causes any reaction. They are a great addition to my routine since I use a strong retinoid and need to protect my skin barrier, but these ingredients should help just about every skin type. While some might be skeptical of skincare products improving skin, even my kid has noticed how great my skin looks since I started getting more serious about it 6-12 months ago."

They contain some of the most beneficial ingredients to keep my skin soft and smooth. This product is packed with Niacinamide which is all the rage in skin care products.

I always start out with a clean face. Most toners are applied with cotton balls but this toner is patted on and some what layered in the application process, that is why you merely pat it into your face and let it dry well. Then you apply the serum which is a very lightweight serum that easily penetrates the skin and starts boosting the healing of my skin. The bottle of toner is larger as it takes about 3 pumps to adequately cover the face and remember to layer the applications. The serum is so lightweight and easily smooths to cover the entire prepped facial area with 2-3 drops.

After the serum is completely absorbed, add a moisturizer and proceed with applying makeup. The healthy glow and softness of my skin has sold me completely on this product and I highly recommend the purchase as the price is really decent for this product."

What I love about Cosrx having tried their products previously is they have high quality ingredients without breaking the bank. Copper Peptide and Niacinamide are two of the top ingredients for skin care. I have attached a copy of the ingredients for both products so you can decide for yourself. For the ingredients listed what there is the most of is first and what's they're the least of is last. This is important buying any skin care product. Fo example, if the product says it has an Niacinamide you want to see it towards the top and not at the bottom of 30 ingredients.

This is not an instant product it takes at least a couple weeks to notice a difference and maybe sooner if you use it day and night.

The serum itself is a half an ounce and the toner is about 5 oz. The serum a little bit goes a long way and you do want to use it sparingly. The combination of both products left my skin feeling very soft and moisturized."

I like COSRX products in general, and had high hopes for these eye patches. My added confidence also comes from knowing that hydrogel masks work better for me compared to woven sheet masks in providing that occlusive layer to help direct hydration into my skin. That said, while I enjoy using these eye patches and they do somewhat make my under eye puffiness look less severe after use, I do not find them hydrating enough for me."

I have very sensitive skin and am extremely selective of what products I use because of that.

First, these don’t even stay in place at all. I even laid down and they just fell to the side instead of down when I was briefly standing for a moment.

Even the momentary opportunity this had to get on other places of my skin irritated it tremendously and burned so bad. While the skin around my eyes is okay, the cheek area just below my eyes began to burn and turned red. I wiped it off and cleaned it up but it still burned horribly.

Very disappointed and returning the product immediately."

They’re infused with peptides, collagen, and caffeine, which are known for helping to depuff and brighten the delicate under-eye area. You can use them in the morning before applying makeup or even as part of your nighttime routine for a little extra hydration.

To use, place the patches under your eyes and leave them on for about 10-15 minutes. They’re great for prepping your skin before makeup, as they help smooth out the area and make concealer apply more evenly. They come in a convenient jar with 60 patches, so you get plenty of uses out of them.

If you’re looking for a way to give your under-eyes a refreshed and hydrated appearance, these patches are a fantastic option, especially for those days when your eyes need a little extra TLC!"

I’ve been sick the past few weeks and these have been the only thing to really help rid the dark circles and bags under my eyes to make me look “half decent” haha! They have 4 Petides, Collagen AND Caffeine in them!

I can be sitting at a desk, working and they STAY PUT! WHAT! Who knew such a feat of science was possible. I can leave them on for about an hour and they still seem to be moist.

I was very happy to find these worked well too. I like putting these are before bed or in the early morning before presentations. These help give less racoon-y and more alert eyes that are particular helpful for all-nighters I pulled due to certain projects. The patches have a slight cold touch which could just be due to the cold weather. They stay on well and help the eye area.

They are very cooling, even if kept at room temperature (I sometimes put mine in the fridge for extra effect), and the patches stick relatively well. I have only used them 3 times so far, so I can't really speak to the collagen or anti-aging effects yet, but I do plan to continue to use these regularly, so if I notice anything I will update my review.

This is just a small gripe, but one thing I noticed is that the serum doesn't play too well with my undereye concealer. Even after massaging the extra serum in and giving it a few minutes to absorb, my concealer seems to go on patchy over top of it. I could always switch to nighttime use, but the inclusion of caffeine and the de-puffing effect really makes these better for the morning. I will keep playing around with them, and worst comes to worst I will just use them on no-makeup days. Otherwise I have been really enjoying and would recommend these eye patches.

My rating scale:
1 star: Horrible product. If I had paid for this, I would be upset.
2 stars: Pretty bad but not quite horrible. I would not reorder.
3 stars: Just ok. It could have been better, but it also could have been worse.
4 stars: Good! A solid product that met my expectations.

The jar and packaging are quality and mostly written in both Korean and English. I found the masks to be non-irritating and beautifully fragrance free. They are a pretty pink color but very slimy and slippery. I found that the eye masks slid down repeatedly and I had to reposition them for almost 10 minutes. The recommended mask time is 10-30 minutes and by the time I took them off at 30 minutes, most of the serum had become more matte and slightly dry. I found my skin was nice and happy and as such this was generally a pleasant mask experience other than repositioning the masks for a few minutes."

Under-eye patches are a way of life for me, I use them every morning first thing to de-puff my eyes.

These patches include a little tool to help separate them out of the jar they come in. All I really need in an eye patch is caffeine and peptides, but these patches go much further than that. They also contain collagen, niacinamide, betaine, panthenol, hyaluronic acid and sodium hyaluronate. So not only are they going to de-puff, they will also hydrate/moisturize/soothe the area, while also diminishing fine lines, and fading dark circles.

I've only used them a few times now, but I'm already loving them. The directions say that they can be used for 10 - 30 minutes, but I have not kept them on that long. They only need 10 minutes for de-puffing and any time after that I'm sure is beneficial for hydrating and working on wrinkles. The most I have kept them on for has been 20 minutes, and I have noticed that after doing that my under eye area looks a bit smoother.

I am super pleased with these patches and will be repurchasing them when I run out.

Highly recommended
Made in Korea"

So my eyes need a little extra help in the morning. These Korean made patches DO contain the #1 most important ingredient to address this issue: caffeine. I love caffeine because it really does work for pouches and it goes to work quickly. You don't have to ""try it out for two weeks"", nope - it starts working right away to provide temporary relief from this often recurring and common complaint.

These eye patches are absolutely sopping with product. They give you a little spatula thingie to extract a couple from the jar. You need that really because the patches are really slippery and hard to handle. But I'll say once you put them on they do seem to hold in place pretty well. I can feel an active ingredient, probably the caffeine, working in these. And they do work based on my test, for eye pouches. They probably won't do much for under eye circles, as that's more of a genetic issue but for pouches they do make a difference.

This is a typically high quality Korean made product of the best ingredients. Recommended."

With most gel masks, I usually struggle with them slowly slipping down my face and they usually need a little time (probably to dry out a bit) before they'll really stick. This one stayed put almost immediately. And the only issue I had with the fit was the nose area, which was cut too wide for me so the sides stuck out. This is a common issue I have with gel masks though, and I simply fix it by cutting out the nose section and applying it separately.

Unfortunately, I didn’t experience the brand’s claim of ""glowing glass skin after just 1 use."" The glow I got was more muted - the natural oils in my T-zone gave me more of a glow. What I did experience was some improvement in hydration, a reduction in redness and irritation, and slight lifting. But the skin firming effect seemed more like the result of the gel mask being physically pressed against my skin, rather than any specific ingredient or formulation. In fact, I could get the same result with a hydrocolloid bandage, which contains no active ingredients at all.

Overall, this was a better-than-average gel mask, thanks to its great, almost instant adhesion and the pretty good results it delivered. However, it doesn't quite live up to all the claims made by the brand."

These leave me feeling as hydrated and as supple as ever. They give you that great glass skin glow. I find glow generally lasts for a day or so but the hydration is noticeable for a few days beyond that.

They work really well and you wake up with clean, awesome looking skin.

The only downside for me was the price. This used to be a good and affordable brand. Now that they've hit it big and have some loyal customers, they've upped their price on their products. Not unexpected, but still disappointing. Charging 15 bucks for 3 masks is way too much IMO.

A must have in your skincare routine!

First time thing the facial mask sheets. It's really hydrating and has alot of serum. I use the leftover serum on my neck and arms. Should be more than 3 in a pack though.

It says for better results, use overnight. I don't think that's practical for anyone. So try to use these when you know you'll have time to just sit and relax or able to watch TV for a few hours.

It's easy to apply this and feels nice and cool when you put it on. Stays on fairly well, but don't expect to be walking around the house and not have it start falling off.

Skin feels nice and refreshed after use."

In addition, this mask you will leave onf for 2-3 hours. So set aside time for yourself. or you can wear it and do your normal chores at home. Not only does this have a very high concentration of snail, it has collagen as well. My skin is sensitive and some wrinkles. My skin absorbed the ingredients up. I love this mask it made my skin so smooth and hydrated. Definitely worth the value for the money here."

There’s absolutely no flattering way to take a pic in this mask! I just received my masks today. 3 in a pack. I currently have one on and so does my daughter. No burn at all like some masks. The mask feels cooling on my face. It’s slimy and a little sticky but in a good way because it holds up on your face great and doesn’t slide off. I did rip a little bit on the size from pulling it but that’s because I wasn’t gentle. As you can see in the picture I even took the mouth and eye piece & placed them in random spots that weren’t covered.

**Washed my face with the Cosrx face wash, used The Ordinary toner, applied Cosrx snail essence, then the mask. Which is what the directions said to do. I definitely have a glow & my face looks brighter. It is slightly sticky, but so is castor oil. I always wake up super soft after using castor oil so I’m sure it’ll be the same with this. I’m just hoping I don’t break out before a lunch this weekend. My black heads on my nose were non existent. While my mask was applied I could see it pulling my black heads. I had all these little black dots come to the surface. I was hoping when it came time to take the mask off that I would pull what it brought out. So I’ll have to see! I’ll keep updating."

I’m not sure if this was a faulty product as they felt extremely dry when opening and when I put on my face it didn’t stick at all and took it off because it would’ve probably made my face drier. Disappointing at £5 a mask and I usually love CORSX products.

I applied this last night to wear whilst I slept, initially worried it would be super uncomfortable to sleep in but I was pleasantly surprised! It sat nicely on my face, felt cooling and refreshing and after a couple of minutes I completely forgot it was on. Have woken up this morning to smooth, dewy and soft skin! Very very impressed for a first use!

Highly recommend!"

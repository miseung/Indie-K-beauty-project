I pair with REN glow tonic and sunscreen in the morning and with differin gel in the evenings. Great product!"

I have oily, acne-prone skin and a lot of acne scars. I have been using prescription tretinoin to manage my acne, and it’s been working but it’s an extremely drying product.

Every night after putting on my tretinoin cream, I put on a light layer of this product and every morning when I wake up I can see a difference in my skin. My skin looks healthier and my acne scars have been reducing significantly. This is an amazing product and a bang for your buck. If you’re hesitant about buying it, I recommend just trying it."

I wanted to add a fermented substance to my routine as well as niacinamide to clear up the bacteria on my face to reduce the acne. This serum is a great addition so far. It's a watery consistency with no scent. It absorbs quickly, but still easy to spread across across your face and decollate without drying. It only takes a few seconds to dry down, so I don't have to wait long to layer on another serum. I've been using this a few weeks now and I feel like it has kept my acne away as well as kept my skin soft. I wouldn't say it's the most moisturizing serum I've come across, but it adds a small amount. The price is also really good for 2 full oz of serum. It comes with a pump, so it's not as messy as droppers. I would recommend this for anyone with any type of skin, sensitive and has acne to keep your skin clean and healthy"

Some people don’t believe in essences but in my opinion at this price you cannot beat it and this one feels like a thin serum/water. It hydrates the skin as the first step in skincare routine and then you can proceed with a moisturizer and it lets the moisturizer sink-in better. I love it and will definitely repurchase."

I spreads very easily with its thin texture, is hydrating and makes my skin so soft.

The hard part about this essence is that the main ingredient can be sensitizing to some people, as you can see in other reviews. Sadly, skincare is not one size fits all, which really sucks. I would definitely recommend introducing this essence by itself for at least two weeks before/after switching anything in your routine. Do not add it if your skin is already irritated, you’ll just be mad at yourself 😭.

I had been using tretinoin for three months before I started using this, my skin was doing well and had acclimated to it at that point, no irritation. Omg, it changed the texture of my skin in only a few days! My skin got so soft and smooth. Yes, I know tretinoin is made to do this too, but it’s a little too coincidental for me for it to have improved that much at the same time as introducing this essence. I’ve been using it for almost two months now and my skin is still as soft and smooth as when I started. Also, it has helped reduce my oil production because of the extra hydration and small amount of Niacinamide. I had trouble with The Ordinary Niacinamide serum drying me out and just making my face HURT, so I thought I was sensitive to it, but I think it was the formula and percentage of it that I had a problem with. So if you had the same problem, don’t be scared of trying this with it’s smaller percentage!

Oh, I almost forgot! I live in a dry climate with combination sensitive prone skin! I hope this helps!

EDIT: 2 years later

I am still in love with this essence, I once tried to stop using it about a year into using it to see if it was truly making a difference and it really does. I ordered it after a week of non use, because I couldn’t stand how quickly my fungal acne came back. I have to say it still does exactly what it did from the beginning. It keeps away all the little bumps from the fungal acne I get from all the sweating that happens living in the desert and still helps with my oil production."

skin background and issues:
im in my 30s and my skin keeps changing, so i will think i have solved my problems and then new ones crop up. i have oily, acne prone skin that has become very sensitive and reactive. for a while, not washing my face but using micellar waters really helped, but not exfoliating ultimately led to a host of different problems. i used to be able to exfoliate all the time to even out tone and texture (which i know is ill-advised, but my point is that my skin used to love it) and now i can only do that once every week or two, but even then my skin would get upset at the trauma. i have tried chemical exfoliants as well as physical exfoliants and neither is ideal, but physical is slightly better but you can only do that so often. one chemical exfoliant i tried (recherche p50!) triggered peri-oral dermatitis around my mouth, nose, and eyes anyway, so that further limits my ability to exfoliate and what products i can use. anyway the accumulation of dead skin increases sebaceous filaments and other annoying skin issues to battle, plus the dermatitis, it's just been a nightmare. this stuff has really saved my skin! (after this product, i use Medicine Mama's Sweet Bee Magic All In One Healing Skin Cream on the spots with dermatitis followed by Weleda Calendula Diaper Rash Cream - my dermatitis is almost completely gone!!)"

I don’t dare continue it. These products feel good on the skin and can give a subtle glow; I never had irritated skin (itchy or burning) so I was quite sad about my skin forming bumps. Either this product or Purito’s Centella serum or maybe even the centella sunscreen has caused some small red bumps on my skin. I’d assume it’s related to the ferment filtration of this product yet I can not be certain. I wanted to be able to continue using and to repurchase and to get even more of purito products so I was quite sad to have it not work for me and I don’t think returning is possible.

I highly recommend this as a step to a very complicated skin care regimen. Remember, skin care is kind of like going to the gym. The more you go in the more consistent you are and the more you put into it the better results you're going to see.

But the Sulwhasoo was so heavily scented to the point that my husband has a hard time sitting next to me. Most of SK II products contain parabens which were off putting to me. I decided to try cheaper alternatives and I’m so glad I found Purito with short ingredient list and this is the only niacinamide serum I tried that doesn’t break me out (I do see some negative reviews about skin breaking out. So it’s likely the niacinamide causing flares or skin is just reacting to it). I’m “allergic to vitamin c serums. It tends to cause rash or skin bumps on me. I’ve been trying to find a vitamin c alternative and I think this is the real magic potion for me. I use it once daily at night with my tretinoin. And I wake up with really smooth skin and the tone is brighter after just a week. I will have to try it longer to see if it helps with fading the spots, but I go to a dermatologist to take care of my hyperpigmentation. I doubt if this serum really gets rid of stubborn dark spots. But it definitely made my skin softer and the tone is brighter. It doesn’t seem to work too well under my Mizon Bb cream. It doesn’t cause pilling but it has a shiny texture to it. So I only uses it at night. I’m not comparing this to the luxury skin care I used to use, but I’m pretty happy with the results so far and of course my wallet is a lot happier too!!"

There was slight redness on my neck at the early stages of using this product, but that eventually dissipated. The smell wasnt the greatest but it goes away as soon as it’s applied to the face.

The biggest issue I have is how quickly the product oxidizes. It’s not clear whether it’s the product and/or how long it has been stored before shipping out that causes it to oxidize so quickly. I’ve had this bottle for exactly 2 months before it oxidized as seen in the yellow color in the photo. I still have about one ounce left from a 2 ounce bottle after daily use for two months. It’s such a waste of a product to have to throw half a bottle away. Perhaps Purito could consider supplying smaller bottles to deter waste of products from oxidation. Only then will I consider buying this product again."

I like the outcome/result of the product, but am not a huge fan of the stinging sensation during application and for this reason will not be purchasing again.

This is a 10% concentrate of Vitamin C with 84% hyaluronic acid. In other words: this stuff is CONCENTRATED. I've tried Vitamin C serums from Maelove, Timeless, etc. and, whether its true by concentration of ingredients or not, this stuff definitely feels more potent because it stung when it first hit my face. So, if you're a beginner or have sensitivities to acids, I don't know if I would recommend this stuff. Having said that, I have sensitive skin and I love this stuff. I'd notice minor to moderate results with other Vitamin C serums, which is more in line with real world results. With this stuff I had noticeable results pretty quickly, which surprised me. Maybe its because of the hyaluronic acid, the formulation, or other ingredients. I'm not sure, but I will continue to use this stuff.

I also really, really love the pump bottle. The eye droppers with most vitamin C serums annoy me.

Regarding the smell: yes this serum does have a slight earthy smell to it, but it only lasts a few seconds.

Regarding the color of the serum: I ordered my Vitamin C serum from Purito's Amazon store front ""PURITO KOREA"". The serum I received was clear and seems 100% legit to me. I'm sure it will oxidise some over the next couple of weeks like many other serums. I will try and post an update."

While it did lighten and brighten, it caused a crazy amount of redness and irritation, smelled horrible, and oxidized within a few months even though I kept it in the fridge.
-----

This product has a really awful smell-- a metallic, meaty odor. When I first used it I didn't think I'd be able to get past the smell, but I eventually found a technique that works for me-- I apply a thin film of this in the morning to a dry face, then wait for it to completely dry on my skin. After that I apply moisturizer on top. This seals in the scent under the moisturizer. If you apply moisturizer before it is completely dry/absorbed, it mixes in with the moisturizer and you will smell the horrible hot dog odor all day. It does sting and makes my cheeks get a little bit red/irritated. However, I am also using Differin several nights/week so it may just be that my skin is unusually sensitive. The redness does calm down after about 20 minutes, though, and it helped by a light application of Aquaphor. This product does work, though! I definitely noticed fading of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (the dark spots that can follow acne) and an overall brightening effect. I poured 2/3 of the bottle out into a spare amber glass dropper bottle that I had and I keep that in the fridge so that it would last longer. As noted in the info above, the product does start out with a pale yellow color and according to Purito, it is still okay to use unless it oxidizes to the point where it is dark brown. This is the first vitamin C product I have used, so I'll bet there are more elegant formulations out there, but this works well and is reasonably priced."

The serum seemed unopened, I assumed I would need to prime the pump however it was already primed, and a large squirt of serum came out. It is clearish with a slight hint of yellow. It smells very faintly of citrus. (It could smell stronger, my allergies are terrible at the moment)
The serum absorbed quickly into my skin, no issues there. It has 10% ascorbic acid and hydrolyzed collagen, these two ingredients can be sticky or tacky feeling but I felt none of that once It absorbed.

My skin is plumper, firmer and brighter overall. I don't see much improvement in my dark spots, but it generally takes time to fade them anyways, so I'll repurchase and see how it works over time. HOWEVER, I put 3 stars because it's got too much Hyaluronic Acid. I live in dry cold climate, so I don't want to put too much Hyaluronic Acid especially in winter. Well, regardless the weather/location, who needs that much Hyaluronic Acid anyways?? 89% is ridiculously high, IMO. It should be not too high nor low so that it works for everyone. If some hydrating/soothing ingredient (ie. green tea extract or water) is the first ingredient instead of Hyaluronic Acid, then I'll be purchasing this forever!

It depends on products, but the yellow color usually does NOT mean it's oxidized. I've used so many Vit C products, but they were all slight yellow when arrived. If the color turns more like orange, then it's oxidized. It's better to check the manufacturer's website or contact the on this to be 100% sure since it depends on products."

However I happened to be browsing one day and came across this sponge by Purito. I love their Green Level sunscreen and I decided to indulge as the price was fair and my face had been feeling a bit more congested than usual.

I have to say I have really been enjoying this sponge! I use this at night during my shower after my first cleanse to remove makeup and with my second cleanse facial wash. The texture is very interesting as it is rock hard when dry but turns into a very soft, mesh-like texture when wet. It very gently exfoliates - the domed side is more gentle while the flat side is a bit more rough. The instructions say not to use it one your face for too long and I can attest to that! The first time I used it I ended up scrubbing for too long and got some flaky skin around my nose and on my forehead (nothing moisturizer didn't fix). But that was my own fault because it felt so nice to use! When used the appropriate amount of time it leaves my face extra soft and smooth and I don't feel like my pores are congested anymore. I also like the shape of the sponge as it makes it easy to use on all the areas and crevices of your face. There is also a string attached to hang it while it dries. The only reason I am taking off a star is because even though I have been gentle with it, it is starting to flake off pieces after about two months. i know konjac sponges do not last forever, but depending how long this Purito one lasts I will update my review/rating. But if you are on the fence, buy it!"

As someone with psoriasis, eczema, and year-round dry skin: I wouldn't call this a ""sleeping pack"" or a ""deep moisturizer"" For me, this is a light hydrator like, I would consider it a daytime moisturizer. And it does work great with makeup! But for nighttime, it's not thick enough or moisturizing enough for my skin. Don't get me wrong- YES this is a great moisturizer ❤️ it is hydrating, has a lovely scent, great texture. 😀 It might be a great nighttime choice for someone with oily skin or severe acne. But I was having to layer this on with 2-3 quarter size amounts with 3 or 4 more products to get the advertised effect out of it so I probably won't buy again

At night, I use an active, serum, and Purito’s Oat-in moisturizer. But in the winter air, it’s sometimes not enough and I wake up with my face dry. So a few nights per week, I add in this Sleeping Pack as a final layer. When I wake up, I can still feel it a bit tacky on my face (in a good way) meaning it hasn’t completely dried out nor absorbed into my pillow, so I know my face is staying better moisturized overnight. It’s not sticky and doesn’t “stick” too much to my pillow either which is nice.

I also like to apply a layer before flying in the dry plane air and it keeps my face moisturized throughout the flight.

I’d describe the texture not so much as a sleeping pack but moreso as a “heavier moisturizer” or a typical “night cream.” It’s a little thick but not uncomfortable or suffocating to wear. On nights that I use retinol, which dries my skin out, I mix in a little half-pea sized amount of aquaphor to make it even more occlusive and protect my skin from flaking. I’m thinking of trying the Purito “Barrier Balancing Balm” for retinol nights instead when I need to punch up the occlusiveness even more.

Overall a great heavier winter moisturizer for dry air. I love that it’s unscented and the quality for the price point is reasonable. A little goes a long way, too, - about a pea-sized amount is plenty to cover my whole face. So I’ll have the bottle for quite some time and would definitely repurchase."

I’m in my 50’s and my skin has become sensitive. After using this for several nights, I noticed my skin felt itchy in the morning, with a bit of redness in some areas. My skin can be that way sometimes do j wasn’t sure if it was the cream. After washing my face/ using day cream/ serums it went away. I switched to my usual daytime moisturizer and no itching.

First, I did a test spot.
Day 1, I noticed a hardly noticeable slight tingle on my face, but my face felt so so soft in the morning.
Day 2, same tingle but no change in appearance.
Day 3, I woke up with hives, and a swollen red face.

I 100% do not trust this brand. I have many products with the squalene, and I have never had this happen to me. I was given hydrocortisone to heal this rash.

I even did a patch test on my hand after to see if this is what caused a rash, and it did the same thing."

It’s $48 and centella asiatica is one of the LAST ingredients, even though it’s called Cicapair. (What a racket, right?) I scoured online articles and Reddit posts and found some GREAT recommendations there. (r/Asianbeauty, r/skincare, etc.) This was one of them, and I’m really liking it so far. I was trying out Drunk Elephant Protini moisturizer, and even it was too heavy for my oily, sensitive skin. This seems to be hitting the mark so far. I was using it on-and-off while sampling Protini, and now I’ve been using it every night for a couple of weeks. No whiteheads like I got with Protini, a fresh unfragranced formula (unlike the Cicapair gel cream, which I’ll admit does smell amazing), and it seems to calm my skin down. If only it had more anti-aging ingredients! It’s hard being in your mid-30s with oily, sensitive skin trying to avoid aging. (I use a niacinamide serum and CeraVe retinol serum, so there’s that. I highly recommend those for sensitive skin.)"

After moving cities, I started experiencing the worst, most prolonged break out of my life. Mostly cystic, hormonal acne. My curology Dr. Added tretinoin to my treatment and it definitely helped but my skin is super sensitive and no product I owned was hydrating enough. My skin was so dry and flakey. I assumed my skin barrier had been compromised because even sensitive skin fragrance free (but drug store) moisturizers burned when I put them on. But one night of a generous application of this cream and I woke up with soft skin with no flakes and some of my post-acne spots noticeably faded.

It feels amazing to put on - definitely don’t need as much as I used. And it rubs in so nicely. The other night creams I’ve tried are thicker and therefore harder to rub in (and that rubbing probably doesn’t help the irritation). It is truly fragrance free.

Was happy to find a moisturizer with so many things my skin likes in one formula and no scent. It calls itself a sleeping pack, but I like using it in the day too. My dry skin drinks it up as long as I don’t use too much—doesn’t make me too shiny.

(The toner is also nice.) It came in really handy when I developed sensitive, dehydrated skin this winter. I had weakened my skin barrier. My face was burning and a lot of my products made my face sting. This product was a godsend, since nothing worked. It calmed and soothed my skin. This serum is fairly thick and I slathered it on. I left it on like a mask, and let it absorb into the skin.

I was able to heal my skin barrier by adding a ceramide serum and probiotics. Unfortunately, this serum only has one ceramide.

If you have dry or dehydrated skin, you will have to apply a moisturizer to prevent the moisture from sleeping out. I always apply a drop of squalane oil when I am done applying my k beauty products to prevent any stickiness or tacky feeling on the skin. Jojoba, argan, or another oil would also work."

It’s got a somewhat watery gel type consistency that reminds me of Aloe Vera gel. It’s very calming when applied to the skin, especially if you keep it in the fridge. It sinks into the skin quickly, and doesn’t leave a sticky or tacky residue. And works beautifully under both sunscreen and makeup. However, if you’re particularly dry, then this won’t be enough hydration for you. Better to pair it with a moisturizer for the best results. For me, I found that a nicely hydrating sunscreen works just as well as a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I use it to hydrate and calm the skin after I’ve applied my vitamin C serum, and before I’ve applied my sunscreen."

I just noticed the reviews stating that it has witch hazel, and it may have in the past but it does not as of when I first posted my review in late 2021. If you have dry/sensitive skin, this should absolutely be in your daily routine along with a good set of day and night moisturizers.
I tried using witch-hazel-based toners, micellar water, and astringents too many times to count. The witch hazel and astringents were all too harsh and too drying and the micellar water did nothing at all. My skin is currently VERY dry. Even though this toner feels like nothing going on, it's super calming and hydrating and you can see the excess dirt that it is able to pick up on your cotton pad. I wash my face thoroughly, so that's how I know it's working. Not only that, but the next day after using this for the first time, my skin was 80% less dry!! I bought this product with my own money, I'm just raving about it because it worked miracles for me. It dries quickly without leaving the skin sticky or any kind of residue."

I have red, bumpy skin with large pores and I find most face products too irritating. I have no irritation from this toner and I've seen immediate improvement. Very pleased.

UPDATE with photos:
Started using Purito Centella Unscented product line 4 months ago and seeing impressive results. Less redness, smaller pores, smoother skin, healing acne scars. My skin is incredibly sensitive and almost all other skincare products I've tried have caused irritation, itchiness or tighntess on my face. It is such a relief to finally have skincare products that work and don't cause irritation."

I have dehydrated combination skin that is very sensitive.

This is great for all skin types. It's hydrating and doesn't make my forehead greasy. I apply multiple layers for extra hydration. It's great for soothing itching or stinging. I also use it as a diy toner mask.

If you have acne, you will love this. The cica calms redness and helps acne scars heal. I had a really nasty scar from popping. I applied this with the recovery serum and the scab came off in 2-3 days, plus a toner mask for 5 minutes. I genuinely thought I would have a permanent brown mark.

Personally, I prefer the original scented formula. It seems more refreshing and soothing to me, but I always buy the unscented because it's better for my sensitive skin. I try to cut out essential oils if it feels irritated.

It might seem sticky or tacky to some, but I don't have this problem. That is common with K-beauty products that have little or no oil. I usually finish with a mist of plain water or a drop of squalane oil to aid absorption. I have also found that using less product and waiting before applying the next product really helps. If you have too much product and too many layers, you will get tackiness and pilling."

Does everything it says it should; super gentle, hydrating, and fragrance free! I have normal to dry skin so this face wash was super hydrating for me. As far as sensitivity goes, I know there are some people who have EXTREMELY sensitive skin so i can't speak for them, but for me this was very non irritating. My skin is moderately sensitive so i needed a face wash that would gently cleanse without irritating it with fragrance and other irritating ingredients and this one definitely came through. I've tried some pretty irritating face washes before that claimed to be all natural or organic but they made my skin either itch, tingle, or burn, and this one did none of those things whatsoever. It foams up perfectly; not too little or too much. Since my skin is kind of dry, i need a hydrating face wash that will cleanse my skin without stripping it, but i prefer a foaming cleanser to a cream and this is perfect for my skin. I was a little worried about some of the reviews that said this face wash was stripping to the skin but as soon as i tried it out, i found that it wasn't stripping at all. I love how basic and clean the ingredient list is and how affordable this product is! A little goes a long way so this will last me awhile. I've tried some of PURITO'S other products and have never had a problem with them either. I also love that this is ph balanced so it won't wreck your skins natural moisture barrier. I'm overall a big fan of this brand and would purchase this product again as long as they don't change the formula. I'd give this face wash a 10/10!"

This is nearly entirely free of any scent, and has the perfect cream gel texture that absorbs quickly and is fairly non greasy. Most importantly, I can wear this on top of serums and under sunscreen in 90+F, 50+% humidity, and it doesn't clog my pores and make a sweaty mess.

Additionally, I have combo, sensitive skin, and this is a dream in terms of skin comparability! Even many ""sensitive skin"" products give me redness and a burning sensation, but this product feels soothing and does not make me break out. Well done, Purito!"

The product did however come in the old box for the essential oil formulation so for a second I thought they sent me the wrong product, but inside was the new version so I am glad they are recycling their packaging I guess.

At least with this one being white - I can wear it places other than just my house, as it's invisible on my skin. The cream is unscented. I've been wearing this cream as a step in my regular skin care routine, and it is playing well with my other skincare. Unlike a silicone based cream, this one doesn't pill when I put moisturizer/makeup/sunscreen overtop. I have dull, aging, combination skin that has a tendency to be sensitive. This cream is super light and doesn't clog my pores, and unlike vitamin c cream, it doesn't make my skin sting, it's very gentle. Has not caused any sensitivity for me. I do wear a moisturizer with this cream, as it isn't moisturizing enough on its own, at least not in wintertime.
This cream is vegan and not tested on animals. It comes in a tube made from recycled plastic. It contains sea buckthorn and niacinamide, which I'm hopeful in time should brighten up my dull skin. All good things! This cream is powerful yet gentle - I like it."

Affordable but very nice and my skin loves it. Will be ordering more Purito (and I just reordered this after not using it for a while and so glad I did - my skin loves it! Purito, Cosrx, Beauty of Joseon, and TirTir are such beautiful skincare brands.)
-----

I use this as my third step in my skincare routine: cleanse, spray toner, and then this essence. I usually use a reusable cotton pad to apply it to my face after cleansing. It's watery/thin as essences are supposed to be more watery versions of their thicker serum sisters.

I have no irritation to my skin, even with my slight rosacea-prone skin.

This is my second Purito product to try and I love that they are affordable options. Their squalane oil is wonderful - I use it last in my routine to seal in everything and I'm sad they don't have it any longer.

Just keep in mind that this isn't supposed to be thick like a moisturizer or serum, but is made to be thin. If you are doing skincare steps, whether your own, or K-Beauty Skincare routine, or something in between, then using this after your toner and before your serum, and then whatever other products you use after serum, your skin will love you for it - if you skin can handle multiple products that is! Always test out a product first. I've found, so far, that Purito has been gentle enough for me.

Thanks for reading and take care of your skin - when you reach my age (60s) you'll be glad you did! I wish I'd have known 10, 15, or 20 years ago what I know now! So many options now. So much more information - take advantage of it and love your skin -- and you don't have to spend a lot to do it! Just do your research and have fun."

I have been buying and testing Japanese and Korean beauty products happily. They work effectively. The benefits of using them show in the result of beautiful, healthy skin.

The first time I used this Essence I was shocked at how fast and completely it removed patches of dry skin that came from a moisturizer I bought after watching Selena Gomez show her skincare routine (she has dry skin). That moisturizer created patches of dry skin wherever I had applied it. Lucky for me the Essence arrived a few days later to rescue my distressed skin. The Essence instantly hydrated my skin, brightened, and healed it. The next morning I was astonished to see clear baby skin.

But after using this Essence for a few weeks I learned to use it alone after washing my face. It works fantastically to hydrate, moisturize and heal by itself. When I use a serum, toner, or moisturizer over it, my face and neck will break out in little bumps under the surface of the skin.

Also, it works best when it is NOT used daily. Alternating this Essence with BIBA de Sousa Plant Stem Cell Serum W. Peptides and Purito Centella Unscented Serum will result in super star unbelievably GORGEOUS skin! No moisturizer is necessary! This Essence and serums do not clog my pores.

No matter how light and refined a moisturizer, I only recently discovered moisturizers enlarge and clog pores. While microblading my face I was horrified to see the lightweight WHITE moisturizer pop out of pores and cling to the length of the blade as I swept it across my face! I had mistakenly believed moisturizers were totally absorbed into our skin. Now I know they do not get absorbed. They sit in and clog and enlarge our pores!
Sometimes great results come from decluttering products and multiple steps. I highly recommend simple steps. Quality products, like this Essence. A+++++."

Liked the eye cream and ended up getting the serum and day and night creams, too, as I ran out of other products. Was okay with all these until I got the essence. Now I LOVE them all! I'm in my 50s and nothing was helping my under-eye wrinkles. I was fairly cautious with the essence until one day I got sloppy and got it up under my eyes. When I looked in a mirror later, I couldn't believe how much better that area looked. Now I put it on right after I wash my face or take a shower. It is not irritating (unless you get it in your eye and then it minorly stings for a few blinks). It significantly plumps my under-eye skin to reduce wrinkles and dark circles. I also use a smidge of the serum, the eye cream and tiny bit of Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen. It seems like my makeup applies better under my eyes as well. All the Purito products work well together, but I think the essence is essential!"

-Missha Time Revolution is nice but I definitely think this makes my skin smoother and more supple. I feel like I need less of this to accomplish more.
-HadaLabo Goku Jyun isn’t that impressive to me, especially after trying Purito Boosting. My skin’s left feeling dry from it whereas Purito Boosting leaves my skin much softer.

The Purito is great for sensitive acne-prone skin like mine, and it never leaves my skin oily anytime of day. It plays nice under my other products regardless of brand. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS!! Oh, and I’m 43, & this has definitely helped my skin to age gracefully!!

* I DID NOT RECEIVE ANYTHING FOR THIS REVIEW, IT SEEMS IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT GIVEN HOW MANY FAKES ARE OUT THERE :)

Original: This stuff is really good. I’ve used other essences before, but this is the first “starting essence” I ever used. I did lots of research on the top products most recommended (Sk-II, Missha, Secret Key), and somehow landed on this one despite it not being rated as highly/often as the others. I simply liked the ingredients better (actually, I liked the fact I could find an English ingredient list more easily than the competitors).

So, while I can’t compare this to others, I do know it feels incredibly soft the moment it touches my skin. My skin drinks it up, & despite how watery & wet it feels going on, it dries as quickly as I hoped it would. As it dries while I rub it in, my skin feels so smooth.

I haven’t been using it long enough to speak of long term results, but I do know my skin has a very healthy glow to it now. Even if I’m fighting hormonal acne in some places, my unaffected skin still looks so good. I’m excited to see what transformations occur as time goes on. If I see lightening effects & a decrease in hormonal acne, I will definitely repurchase this. It’s got very healthy ingredients and no bad stuff thrown in with it."

However I'm lucky to have found a great shade match. I'm wearing 21, which is a fair/light true neutral beige color. I feel a lot of the review photos do not do this shade justice as it looks a lot less grey dry vs wet. Sure it might look ashy on some people but if you're very neutral and beige like me and everything seems too orange, yellow, or pink then try this out. Know your skin color theory!

Coverage: this actually has good coverage for a bb cream. It's definitely buildable. I'm only wearing one layer in the photo and my freckles are slightly coming through. I would say it's medium coverage.

Texture: this gives a skin like texture. It is the best foundation I've own, I don't even need a primer. It doesn't highlight my dry spots or enlarged pores. I have some fine lines around my mouth and it doesn't settle. Ive heard it works well on oily and dry skin. I have combination... Update! My 60 year old mother tried this in shade 27 and this looks great on her mature skin. We used the finger method to blend out. She is Afrolatina with light warm caramel skin. This was a good shade for her.

Note for oily people: just updating my review because I used this product in a tropical climate. In tropical climates my skin becomes more oily. However, I still liked this bb cream! It gives me a healthy glow, it stayed on through the sweat even though I had no setting powder. I also am updating this review with a photo of me in the tropics. Remember folks the finish is dewy like most Korean skin products. Saw someone say it's not for oily people but I think it depends more what type of finish you prefer. I agree if you are a matte girly this product may not be for you.

Overall this is the best bb cream and foundation Ive ever worn. It performs better then expensive brands like Nars and Armani for me. For the price it's worth a shot. Just please make more shades so I can recommend this to my friends!"

It's light enough that it doesn't give me an orange tinted face, and I see no traces of pink or peach undertones. Would never guess my shade by its name. It is not gray at all. Doesn't leave demarcation lines, so I don't even have to blend it on my even paler neck. I'm using only about a pea sized amount on my whole face and it makes my skin look so good. Covers what it needs to cover, but my skin is still visible. Sits well on the skin, looks natural or even healthy and doesn't cling to dry spots when those are present. Does not look cakey on me. It won't melt off from my super oily face even when having it on for the whole day in the summer heat. By the end of the day it won't look its best due to my oils showing through, but it is still presentable without any touch up. Great price and perfect shade match."

I got it and tried swatching it a few times on my face and felt like it did absolutely nothing, but yesterday had some extra time so I did a full face using a brush instead of my fingers and OMG it's amazing!

I will agree that the shade is a little on the gray side, but I'd prefer that over it making me look orange. It's also VERY lightweight, to the point where I almost forgot I was wearing it! The only thing that I felt ""weighing down my face"" was my contour/blush. I have really sensitive skin, and eczema on my face, and this is one of the first foundations/bb creams that has not caused me to break out (normally do within an hour or so), and was very easy to reapply and blend in on my eczema spots since nothing is going to last there for 8+ hours.

Overall very impressed and happy with this! Also I feel it should be noted that applying it with a brush gave enough coverage that while wasn't FULL full coverage, I did not feel the need to use any concealer! Like yes, I had some acne spots that showed through it, but they were raised and would've been noticeable with our without concealer, and I was putting blush over them anyways which negated the need for concealer."

My skin tends to break down a lot of foundations, but not really this one. It's also fairly hydrating. Has a nice, lightly glowy finish, though I like to powder. The drawback though, is that the shades all have wildly strong undertones and are fairly dark. #21 is aggressively gray pink and more for light-medium skin. #13 is like a strong peach, but it's about 3 shades too dark on me (m.u.f.e. r210ish). I have to mix this 50/50 with a white mixer, which is sad because it alters the finish for the worse. I'll keep wishing for a more proper shade range here, but if you're in the middle of the shade spectrum, you'll have luck."

From my understanding, some of the Asian branded ones are just like this one, where you squeeze the tube and what comes out looks like gray clay rather than anything resembling human skin color. The magic happens once you apply it to your face - the color changes to your skin tone somehow and at the same time, hides any redness that you have. I have a bunch of redness around the nose from broken capillaries and this makeup just covers it up like medium to full coverage foundation. My face ends up looking very even in tone and has that polished dewy look like I just slaved for 30 minutes putting on all kinds of makeup products to achieve this very look. I'm quite happy that I can get that look with just this product because I am definitely not a makeup person!

One thing that will take some time for me to get used to is the initial tackiness. It takes about 15 minutes for the tackiness to go away so your face doesn't feel like a sticky mess. You definitely still feel like you're wearing makeup, but after that point, your hair is safe from sticking to your face. Also, I don't trust the sunscreen protection of these makeup products, so I tend to apply a real sunscreen beforehand (if you're doing this, you should wait about 15 min for the sunscreen to sink in before applying this cream)."

I so wanted to be able to use their BB cream, but the shade range was too limited so I was glad to see #31 bc 27 was too light for me. Sure enough 31 is too dark BUT mixing 27 and 31 using about a 2:1 ratio (31 to 27) I was able to get a closer match. I noticed after a week of use that the spf worn under this makes a difference ie any spf with the slightest white case and I’ll need a little more 31 to offset the ghost show. The most important thing I noticed is warming the BB cream (mixing the two shades rubbing my fingers together as shown in their video) made a huge difference in the smoothness of the application and the color match. Purito’s video demonstrating how to apply is spot on. Depending on the ratio used, a mix of 27 and 31 should create shades from NC42-NW55. I initially thought the leap from 27 to 31 wasn’t quite right, but now I see it allows for a greater shade range, if you are willing to mix until you find what works for you. I also noticed some calming of minor irritations after a week of use so, it’s kind to my skin. I hope they continue to expand the shade range in both directions so everyone can find their match because it’s a good product - covers just enough blemishes to still look natural, blurs pores a bit too. If I use too much it highlights my pores so I stick to a light application. Worth a try…"

It always looked unnatural, and I started to think the problem was ME and not the foundations. When I tried this product, I had little to no expectation that it would actually work and look beautiful on my face. I bought it on a whim because it was cheap and I wanted to try out some Korean products to see what they were about. Aaaand this is why you should never judge a book by its cover/price tag. Amazon tells me I have purchased this product 15 times, but it’s really been way more than that because I originally starting ordering it off of YesStyle before I realized I could find it on Amazon. I’ve been wearing this for a few years now, almost daily. People always comment on how glowy my face looks (even after setting with powder). It looks so natural sometimes people don’t even think I wear makeup. I have very fair skin and pink undertones, and always purchase shade #21(light beige). It goes on pretty dark so it can look kind of scary at first but I promise it dries down so wonderfully. I will continue to order this until it’s discontinued or no longer available.

I need full coverage because I sometimes get a break out, I have dark circles under my eyes, I have acne scars and I just honestly don’t like my skin on my face. I’ve tried 1000 BB creams and they are too sheer for me so I always end up going back to foundation. I think foundation is good for occasions but I was tired of wearing it daily because it’s heavy or it just causes more breaks out. ( and honestly I’m not great at washing my face nightly) I tried this stuff and I’m never using anything else. First off, it’s not sheer, it’s buildable. It makes your skin look dewy ( like a healthy glow), you can defiantly bake with setting powder if you want , and do concealer if you want but this stuff isn’t going to rub off or become blotchy like your foundation does 8 hours later.
If you forget to wash your face at night and fall asleep with it on( don’t make it a habit), guess what it has all the good stuff in it and acne fighting agents that will help your skin .

This BB cream applies nicely with fingers, then pounced over with a damp beauty sponge (that’s been wrung out in an absorbent towel first). But even the lightest shades wouldn’t suit a fair-skinned person.

Also, it’s more opaque than I would’ve expected—not a bad thing, necessarily—and thicker upon application, but using maybe a pea-sized amount to cover the face would do which unfortunately makes this unsuitable for proper sun protection. Basically you can go for an overdone-makeup look to properly utilize the sunscreen aspect of the product (and might as well with how strong the physical sunscreen/titanium dioxide smell is—which doesn’t fade at all to me throughout the day—because that’ll surely stick with you), or you get a nice-looking BB cream without the sun protection if you apply it in a natural-looking amount…

So best case scenario: This product is amazing for someone who wants to start using sunscreen, and doesn’t want a lot of layers underneath to achieve a full-face makeup look. If you live closer to the Equator, I wouldn’t recommend this as a primary form of sun protection.

For me, I’m just going to stick with the Dr. Jart Camo Drops for natural-looking coverage with some sun protection and maybe use this on the days I want heavier skin camouflaging, still with “some” sun protection; and on outdoorsy days, I’ll make sure to use EltaMD’s UV RESTORE (zinc oxide-based = better healing properties and no stinky sunscreen smell) physical sunscreen partnered with either listed-above tinted sunscreens for proper protection."

I'm so glad I discovered BB creams as opposed to standard foundation. And this cream is a joy to put on, it really is stunning coverage and blends super well with my skin. But it's also extremely key that my skin is perfectly prepared for it, i.e. clean and hydrated, allowing for a seamless dewy effect, otherwise it can look a little dry. Other than a good night's rest, I typically can ensure my skin is prepped with the double cleanse method where I start with a cleansing oil, followed by a sheet mask if I feel my skin could use a little extra help. Then I lock in moisture with COSRX Snail Mucin Cream followed by Then I Met You Sunscreen. Once dried, I apply this BB cream with my fingertip, starting slow with small amounts.

I worried the Light Beige would be too dark for my skin but as others mention, it really blends well and is a lovely color on fair skin. Highly recommend, and hope my tips can help any who struggle to reap this beautiful product's benefits."

The color match is also really good. I have YELLOW toned skin. Not warm, not golden, simply yellow and extremely neutral-olive. NARS radiant creamy concealer in macadamia is probably my closest shade match, but they don’t carry that same color in the tinted moisturizer. The #13 neutral ivory of the Purito BB is a very good match to my skin. It’s yellow, but not in an overly warm way.

Only downside is that there’s no SPF but I might prefer it that way because I feel like it layers with other products better without it, and I use SPF in my face lotion anyway."

I love this BB cream! Since my department store color ‘s formula changed I have had the hardest time finding a good match. Also as my skin is aging my skin is drier and I have melasma/dark spots. This foundation gives a beautiful slightly dewy smooth finish. It is not cakey at all and the coverage is awesome. Coverage is more in the lines of a foundation than a BB cream and is buildable. At first it feels a bit thick but you can use very little and smooth it out for a lighter coverage. I add a layer over my dark spots/melasma and it covers it beautifully. I’ve tried color correctors, multiple high end foundations, and concealers and this BB cream beats them all. I have olive skin (I’m half Italian) and need a warm tone (golden undertone not pink). Before this the closest shade I could find was the bottle pictured in a 4.5 neutral. It is a touch too pink but works ok…but this BB cream beats it in finish, coverage and color match after mixing two colors. I use mostly color #27 Sand beige and mix in a small bit of color #13 Natural Ivory. I cleaned out an old foundation bottle and squirted in the BB cream and mixed with the pump tube of the bottle. Also my bottle had a couple beads in it to help mix. A few good stirs and shakes and it’s perfect. It’s very close to the 4.5 bottle pictured but more warm than neutral. Perfect for olive skin. I love that I’ll be able to adjust color for summer and winter if I get darker from sun etc. I am thrilled with the flawless natural look and coverage of this BB cream. Love everything about it. I get so many complements and have recommended it to family and friends. Added some pics of the two colors next to samples I had to help compare colors to other shades. Hope it helps."

(FYI, the foundation comes out of the tube a shade or two darker than it actually is. It dries much lighter.)

I am amazed at how natural it looks. In a liquid foundation, I typically wear L’Oreal True Match Nude, but after a side-by-side comparison, I can see that the True Match is actually streaky and is too matte, making me look dry. I never realized it!

The Purito is just wonderful. It has a radiant finish (not too radiant, mind you — just an inner glow), and I can layer it without it looking cakey. No other foundation I’ve tried does that!

It covers much better than I thought it would. It almost erases my freckles! Yet it’s not heavy.

Plus, this stuff actually looks better than my BareMinerals — and it’s so affordable! Wow!!!

I'm unsure it has enough of the ""good"" ingredients for it to noticeably improve your skin. However, coverage is very decent for a tinted moisturizer, and finding a pink based tone is difficult in most brands. Bobbi Brown says that's because only 1% of women need a pink tone, but when you're out in the sun, it's normal to turn pink, not yellow. It won't fully cover acne, but it helps even things out. With concealer and powder on top, it looks like you're wearing a light to medium foundation. No cakeyness that I noticed; it won't emphasize your pores. Don't expect a miracle, but for the price point, you could do far worse."

Upon using this for the past 5 days, I can state that this product is not meant for oily skin. If you have oily skin, it will reject this product and transfer on your mask or hands. I used to have oily acne-prone skin, and now I have normal to dry skin. It wasn't greasy or oily for me at all.

This BB cream melted into my skin and actually stayed there without needing to use any setting spray. While I pumped it out, I was shocked to see that the color didn't match the packaging in the slightest. It was brownish/gray, but once you put it on the skin, it's as if it blends into your color and gets away any unevenness, including redness. I tested this on the back of my hand before putting it on my skin to see how it would oxidize. Again, I noticed a very weird brown color oxidation but it goes away. When I put it on my face, there are no lines or oxidizing. It turned out being a perfect shade match after all.

This BB cream gives you a plump to the skin, a glow, and a very youthful look. I was also shocked to see that it has medium/buildable coverage. You can wear it sheer but a small pump of product goes a long way. It's easy to blend and I didn't need to moisturize or prime beforehand. I cant imagine how well it would work had I prepped beforehand. Just seeing how well it worked without prepping is a good sign for me!"

I also really wanted to let my skin breathe and I love Purito, so I decided to try it out.

I can’t explain how much I love this! I’ve tried a few BB/ CC creams before and they were really tacky/ sticky or too thick and never worked for me. This feels like a moisturizer and made my skin look so glowy and fresh. I got shade #13 and it is a perfect match for me. I am verrrry pale with neutral to warm undertones so it’s hard for me to find a product light enough that still match my undertones.

I apply a thin layer of this, warm it up and apply with my fingers first and then blend with a beauty blender. Then I just dot concealer where I need it and use a tiny bit of translucent powder over just my oily areas. It actually looks so much better than foundation (in my opinion) and doesn’t feel drying."

This product doesn't appear dry on my dry areas, applies smoothly, and lasts all day.

I do have to mention that I use hydrating products on my face before applying any foundation or BB creams. I use a serum, moisturizer with one or two drops of face oil, followed by SPF lotion. I use face primer only on occasion, when I remember. I always use the face oil with my moisturizer everyday, because I have very dry skin. This is what makes my makeup apply smoothly, regardless of the brand of foundation. I do exfoliate twice a week and that helps with smooth application.

I noticed some other people mention it looks ""grey"" on first application. It does NOT look grey on me and blends beautifully into the neutral tone I need to cover up my redness.

I’ve always preferred a more sheer coverage with glow. I usually achieve this by adding a moisturizer with SPF to a foundation because I’ve never found a BB cream or anything that has the coverage, shade, texture and SPF that I prefer. Until this. I have light skin, pink/cool undertones with a lot of redness. The color 15 Rose Ivory has been the best color match I’ve ever gotten maybe ever. It doesn’t try and just cover up my pink undertones. It covers the red without looking fake over the natural color of my skin. The coverage is SURPRISING for something that isn’t a full coverage foundation. I only needed a small amount and it covered my face. I use it with a glow primer to give it a little more moisture and slip on my skin as my skin is dry but also super breakout prone. I adore this stuff and I’m so mad it took me this long to try it. It feels calming and it washes off easily with a double cleanse. It doesn’t look cakey at all on me it looks super natural. I am so glad I tried this. I realize everyone’s foundation and skin needs are wildly different but for me this is perfection.
If you find it drying at all try with a glow moistening primer and a mist/spray like Glow Recipe, Farsali Tose gold mist or Pixi Glow Mist. All of those helped to give it that little bit of hydration my skin needs. I imagine for anyone with oily skin this would be a dream.
I couldn’t be happier with this. The color match alone, but the add the coverage and texture is just everything I wanted. I don’t think I’ll be wearing anything else daily."

I wanted to leave a review to help anyone else struggling to find a beautiful foundation that doesn’t make their skin look worse. First off when I applied it my jaw literally dropped. Instant coverage beautiful hydration and the color matched my skin so perfectly I couldn’t even see where I blended it to. Im pretty fair skin and very neutral and shade 21 was probably my best ever shade match. I have freckles and my skin is dry, I also have fine lines. This made my skin look so youthful and plump like no other. It erased my dry patches instead of clung to them. I do think this needs to be set with a powder it’s very dewy looking. I used a crappy powder and still got atleast 9 hour wear before it started to fade and show my freckles. 10/10 would recommend the price is amazing as well."

I wanted more coverage than Complexion Rescue (without a foundation look) and a better color match. This is the winner! Like many reviewers I found #21 to be perfection for my fair skin, which is slightly cool. It's rare for me to find such an exact match and not be between shades or a bit off on undertone. I set it with a dusting of Mineral Veil and it lasts all day. The finish is satin--not shiny, not matte. It's my new daily moisturizer and I'm so pleased."

I ordered it for my sister as well and she was so happy with the color, look and finish of it that now it’s one of her favorite foundations.

It just wears beautifully. I don’t set it and it dries down while still looking like I have very healthy skin. If it’s in your cart, if you are on the fence about this stuff just buy it.

Seriously incredible.

It does have a slight smell to it reflecting the ingredients of the product and yes it does smell faintly like hot dogs or metal as someone else pointed out but the smell quickly fades, no issue after a few moments and I have a nose that's easily irritated by scents. For my sensitive skin it is nice using a lower percentage of Vit C while still getting the benefit of pure Ascorbic Acid rather than a derivative. The serum has a fairly light consistency and it soaks in quickly, I have never had an issue with pilling. Also good value for money as it is 2oz. So far I have liked everything I have tried from this brand, though I have no interest in ever trying their sunscreens which come up short when under review, but all of the serums and moisturizers and cleansing oil have been great from this brand (and I really appreciate that every one of their products comes sealed, much more hygienic, sanitary and safe to be able to peel of the seal yourself)"

It's fragrance free and has a very mild neutral scent that you'd expect from a fragrance free product.

It absorbs moderately fast and doesn't leave any stickiness, and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth, it pairs perfectly with my salicylic acid cleanser and niacinamide serum!

This is a lightweight moisturizer that has a very gel like texture. Both times I have used this, I put it on over night. I woke up both times with smooth, hydrated skin that had a healthy glow. Im a 10/10 with sensitivity and my skin reacts easily and thus far this has not caused any irritation, bumps, redness, itchy skin or acne. I haven't used this during the day time as I am using the Purito's SPF for daytime. I recommend this for sensitive or reactive skin that needs some hydration!
side note: I saw someone complaining about smell. This product has zero smell.
and: The ingredients in this are near perfect, as far as being both gentle and beneficial, non-comedogenic, non-acneic, soothing, moisturizing, brightening, non-iritating, silicone free, oil free, alcohol free, fragrance free, sulfate free, paraben free etc.

Update: After using this for about 2 months, I am HUGE FAN. I use this in the daytime now and it leaves such a healthy glow on my skin. I have never had any reaction to this moisturizer. My skin seems to be healing over time to the point that people have commented. This product does its job and does it well. I think this is what people call the Holy Grail when they find it. SO, this is my Holy Grail in the lightweight moisturizer category! I certainly hope Purito doesnt mess with this formulation."

This feels heavenly and soothing. I start with a couple layers of essence. My favorite is Purito CIca. Serum. Oat gel. Dry and irritated spots get treated with a bit of CIca Recovery Cream.

I have been using this product for a few months now. I purchased this after I saw one of the Welsh Twins review it on his YouTube channel. This skinfluencer just couldn't say enough good things about it. He has oily skin, though, and said he applies a moisturizer over it. I have combination skin and didn't find it to be very hydrating or moisturizing. Nevertheless, I think someone with oily skin would like this if they lived in a hot or humid environment.

It has a very faint pleasant smell, slightly reminiscent of vanilla. The consistency is medium thickness, but it's not greasy. It doesn't feel heavy at all. It absorbs into the skin quickly. This is a quality product, buy I don't think I will repurchase.

I personally like the Centella Unscented Recovery Cream better. It's my Holy Grail, and I have purchased it many times. It's allegedly a dupe for a certain tiger balm by a certain Dr. J. I find it to be much more soothing for my sensitive skin and weak skin barrier. It's slightly more hydrating than the oat gel, though not by much. I like to layer the two if my skin is really irritated. Or I will apply retinol after the oat gel, and top off with the cream. Both products are good for people with acne. If you have dehydrated skin, I recommend applying 1-3 layers of the Centella Essence first. That's another Holy Grail of mine."

I've finally found a gel cream that is not silicone- or dimethicone-based since silicone never agrees with my skin and tends to clog my pores, although for many silicone is good for locking in moisture. This gel cream has squalane instead to help with moisturizing, and I really love squalane. I use squalane oil in the winter to help with water loss and dry skin, and squalane never breaks me out. It is surprisingy lightweight and absorbs quickly.

In terms of its claim of soothing effects, this gel cream also contains oat seed water, panthenol, and the salt form of licorice root extract, which together help calm down my skin and soothe minor eczema patches on my cheek in a few days. Since it is not moisturizing enough in winter time, I use it as a serum and layer moisturizer and squalane oil on top, and wake up to soft and silky skin! Last but not least, this gel cream does not contain any ingredient that can trigger fungal ance, which is super awesome since I am also very prone to fungal acne.

This product is truly very watery so I honestly do not think it is a good moisturizing product for dry skin or for people in a dry climate. I use this as a toner.

But as a person who stopped slugging and using moisturizes like cetaphil for some time now, this just wasn’t cutting it. I have been suffering with fungal acne, and two months ago I started my journey with trying out new moisturizers that were fungal acne safe.

This was one of them, but it semi destroyed my skin barrier with how drying it was. If you have oily skin this would be PERFECT. But if you’re someone who has VERY dry skin, this probably won’t work for you.

There is no scent to it, and it absorbs almost immediately leaving no oily residue. It’s very thin like, nothing compared to what I was used to using. I even tried using it with the “ordinary 100% plant squalene”, it helped a LITTLE but the stinging was still there. No matter HOW MUCH I squeezed out, it was just never enough. My skin felt consistently tight and dehydrated with this.

I will say, that you receive a good amount for what you payfor. It can easily last 2/3 months.

Since embarking on this journey, I’ve realized what might work for a majority of people might not actually work for you, even though the diagnosis might be the same. (Fungal acne)

So here’s what actually DID work for me, just in case anyone else may be struggling with the same. “Curell Japanese moisturizer and the Eucerin Orginal healing cream”. Give it a few days to repair your skin barrier, so SO worth it."

The ingredients are great, but it lacks an occlusive that would make those ingredients STAY on your skin and do what they need to do. If this had dimethicone somewhere, it'd probably be perfect.

If you have oily skin that needs no real moisture, or live in a humid area, this is likely for you!

If you already have a good moisturizer and want a little something more that won't break you out, this is a good option!

If you do need moisture, however, this will not give you that. It completely evaporates from my skin after a few minutes and leaves it tighter and dryer than if I had just used nothing at all. Squalane is an oil, but it's not an occlusive oil, meaning that it won't form a layer to protect your skin and keep the water in. Mostly, it's great at tricking your skin into thinking you have enough squalene (a trick which reduces inflammation and oil production) and enhances the penetration of other ingredients. If you live somewhere that the air around you is always humid, then you may fare well with this, because it could draw moisture from the air into your skin. If you have air-conditioning or live somewhere dry, however, I cannot recommend this. It will strip your skin of its moisture and deposit it into the dryer air around you, thus doing the opposite of its proposed function, because it lacks an ingredient in its formulation that would prevent this.

This is fungal acne safe, not pore-clogging, and not irritating whatsoever. There are VERY FEW products in the WORLDWIDE market that can say that. This has clearly been formulated with care in mind and it does not contain needless fillers that hurt your skin or whose only purpose is to make this product more appealing. I wish there were more products like this.

Seeing as this has squalane and other great ingredients, I intend to use it as a layering step should my skin need some extra moisture after a chemical peel, acids, or other harsh actives, but I will not be using it as a STANDALONE moisturizer.

I'd say it's great for layering, as one would with a serum, but I wouldn't recommend it be used alone unless your skin doesn't need much added moisture.

I hope they keep this product, but add a gentle occlusive like dimethicone (or something similar) so that it can protect and smooth the skin and keep its acne safe claims.

Overall, it's not bad; it just needs to be used with something else, too, if it's to be used as a moisturizing product."

This was just average — I’ve had it for over a month and unlike any skincare product I’m in love with, it’s still sitting there, mostly unused. The texture is a bit rough for my liking (I’d recommend lathering in your palms first). It does build up a generous lather, which I appreciate. It also may have triggered a breakout on my acne-prone skin. It tends to stain my soap dish with brown remnants, but that’s minor, as it washes off easily."

After using it 1 or 2 more times I noticed my skin was moisturized & staying supple and comfortable for like 24 to 36 hours after using this soap in my normal routine, where I would have started feeling dry w/in 10 or 12 hours before this soap. My normal routine is wash with soap, use witch hazel as a toner, then a thin layer of coconut oil & then pat my skin dry, so I don't use the soap alone, but having only switched the soap out (replaced Dr Bs castile bar w/this) my skin is staying comfortable and velvety for twice as long.

I’ve had it for a handful of months now and i’m less than haft way through! I’ve definitely noticed my skin looks more vibrant and it’s definitely getting cleaned when i double cleanse. When i stop using this when i’m not wearing makeup for a while i notice my basic foam cleanser doesn’t do as good a job taking my days grim and sunscreen off.
You may think that you don’t need an oil cleanser cause your skin is super oily or acne prone but it’s a must if you wear makeup. It takes all your makeup and sunscreen off. But you MUST follow up with another cleaner (like a foaming one is great) cause this is still oil.
so step by step:
1) pump once into you hands (you can always add more)
2) rub into your face (anywhere you have makeup especially) for about 30sec it doesn’t take long
3) wet your hands and rub your wet hands into your skin for like 10 second (it should become milky looking) now you can either give it a quick rinse or move onto step 4
4) take your basic cleanser (foam works great) and emulsify that with some water and rub into your face. Especially with a foam cleanser your gonna get all the remaining oil and grim off you face
5) rinse and apply whatever you normally do after washing your face (toner/moisturizer)"

Washes off clean, to the point that you don’t notice you used an oil cleanser. I don’t even need to go in for a second cleanse. I actually just tried using it to clean my brushes and it did the job in one go. All my brushes are clean as new.

You do have to spend quite a bit of time massaging it in though to get eye makeup off. I use a face wash afterwards (vanicream) but sometimes even after the two-step cleaning process, I still need to go in with a little bit of micellar water to get off all the eye make-up. The Inkey Lists Oat Cleansing Balm might do a better job of removing eye makeup but it irritates my eyes more than this one. The Then I Met You Cleansing balm has done the best job in removing eye makeup for me, I think, but I don't care for the scent or the price point. I've also used various other oils (e.g. coconut, olive, apricot, jojoba) and I don't like the oily residue they leave behind but they are probably the best at completely removing my eye makeup.

This is an awesome, bare-bones toner. I like having something simple I can pair with my tretinoin + benzoyl peroxide daily acne routine without worry. No niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, fragrance or other irritators. I’ve started applying two layers instead of one, and it gives me a beautifullll glass skin finish. I put on the two layers at night and my skin looks gorgeous in the morning. The scent is lovely too, a very natural, subtle oat smell.

Update: I’ve started using this all over my body before my thick night cream, and it’s amazing. It’s cleared some keratosis pilaris on my bottom, and since using it daily on my armpits, they look lighter. There’s no lightening ingredients in it. I think it’s just like Dr. Dray explains: very hydrated skin has better cell regeneration and will naturally exfoliate/ shed/ renew itself better. Lots of us are taught not to moisturize our armpits. A lotion/ cream could block deodorant too much, understandable, but a moisturizing toner doesn’t in my experience.

This makes my body cream work better. My skin looks and feels thoroughly moisturized and dewy whereas before it was a little dry. It’s too expensive to use all over my body though. I went through the bottle quickly. But this is still my holy grail for my face. I wish there were more value-size, milky, simple toners that I could use on my body, like the TonyMoly ceramide toner. I don’t like that that one has fragrance though.

Other Update: I tried the I’m From rice toner recently. Not bad, but I like this oat toner more. More moisturizing, without being too rich (I have oily-normal skin). I need 3 layers of rice toner to do what 2 layers of this oat toner does. And the rice toner stings."

I got this as a soothing toner for when my face gets flushed after a day of hiking or for the day after I exfoliate to help keep my skin balanced.

The texture is a little thicker than a normal toner, but it goes on nicely and dries down quickly. It’s not sticky or tacky. There’s not really a scent per say, just a light natural oat smell from the ingredients.

I like this toner and found it soothing and moisturizing. It didn’t reduce redness quite as much as I hoped, but I have a moisturizer that I follow up with that does that very well."

This is a nice basic, all-natural toner. I purchased it because my skin barrier is compromised and I have very sensitive skin. Beta glucan is derived from oats and is great for repairing the skin.
This toner is best used in a spray bottle. I tried to apply it directly with my hand, let it absorb, and apply another layer. This was a big mistake, as it left a thin film on my skin. Use this sparingly. A little goes a long way.

This is a very simple recipe that is very close to something that could be made at home -- except it has a longer shelf life. You don't have to worry about it growing bacteria or fungus after a few days."

The toner literally only has 10 ingredients in it - that is really hard to find in skincare products nowadays! So if you are looking for a toner with minimal ingredients, then this one might be perfect for you!

Sustainable and clean beauty have become a new trend in the recent skincare product, and I think we are going into the right direction. Purito mentioned that they have removed unnecessary packaging, stickers and labels also used the recycled plastic for this product. It really came without box packaging, just with soy ink printed manual hanging on the neck of the product. I firmly believe it's praiseworthy direction for a skincare product. So here is what I think about this product.

Ingredients:
What I really like about this product is that it has very short ingredient list. There are millions of companies that adds negligible amount of the exotic extracts, which practically doesn't do anything and try to deceive customers by diluting the harmful ingredients presence in the list. This company doesn't It's based with oat seed water, and quite a bit of conditioning and hydrating ingredients like butylene glycol and beta glucan. It used polyglycerl10 stearate as surfactant/stabilizer, which is considered safe on skin. It used 1,2 hexanediol as preservative / solvent, so practically there is a zero harmful ingredients. It's one of the cleanest beauty product that I have reviewed.

Texture:
As you can see, it has milky color and very watery texture. It practically has no viscosity. Due to the high concentration of oat seed water, it makes skin somehow powdery / silky. It's not sticky and absorbed to the skin very quickly. It CAN be used as wipe off type or tapping type both.

Effectiveness:
To be honest, I am not sure this is deeply hydrating but at least, it leaves skin very silky. I generally use serum and moisturizer afterwards, so it's good enough, but if you are the toner only person, then you may feel this is drying. Definitely, it's very gentle and highly unlikely will make you irritated unless you don't have allergies with oat.

Scent:
It's FRAGRANCE FREE product, and due to the high oat seed water contents, it practically smells like diluted oat milk. It's pretty soothing and nice.

Buy this if you need: a gentle toner for your skincare routine that makes your skin very silky.
Don't if you : are looking for all-in-on hydrating type toner. It's not hydrating enough."

Vegan Ingredients, Cruelty-Free, Facial Toner","Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","I'm sort of obsessed with this now. The relatively minimal ingredients list has everything I want (hydration, soothing, light moisturization) and nothing I don't (more niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, multiple plant extracts, et al). It leaves a terrific glow, helps subsequent products absorb better, and forms a light shield against the environment. It does have a subtle scent (naturally from the oat), but it doesn't linger and is pleasant. I use two layers twice a day and the bottle is still going to last me months. I had been using rice toners (which I love) but all the brands I like use niacinamide and I have more than enough of that in my routine already and was trying to pare back. It excels at being an oat toner instead of trying to be every product in one. That's exactly what I wanted."

Honestly just get this toner, you won’t regret it.

I already left a glowing review on the matching oat moisturizer from this line so I thought I would briefly rave about this toner. I’m a big toner gal, I think they’re so underrated in skincare routines, and it’s toners like this that I would use as an example of all the added benefits of using a toner. It’s soothing, it’s hydrating, it’s glowy, it gives radiant, glass skin. Especially paired with the moisturizer, I’ve noticed my skin is so much less irritated and red, it’s soooo much more hydrated and I feel like my skin barrier is stronger too (let me mention I’ve been using this for about two weeks, maybe less). It has the slightest oat smell but I think it just adds to the ~experience~, and the texture is so milky. I’ve never used a toner with this thin of a consistency and I was actually really skeptical about this one providing enough hydration as I have extremely dry and dehydrated skin, but my skin drinks it right up in a way that I don’t even need to use a serum or anything else before the moisturizer. My routine is now cut down to literally three steps and with much simpler ingredients, yet it has legitimately never looked better."

I love that is has far fewer ingredients and almost all are oat based. It definitely smells oat-based, almost like the oat bath stuff you use for babies. It doesn’t linger, so I’m not bothered since it’s a natural fragrance.

I have eczema and tend to get it around my eyes and nose. I haven’t had any flare ups since using this and my skin is noticbly less red with a more even tone.

I also love that it gives me the same sort of bouncy, dewy glow. I layer up depending on how my skin is feeling. If it’s feeling dry and irritated, I use up to 5 layers at night. In the morning, I use 1 or 2 layers and my makeup sits well on top of this (plus my other skincare products).

I would highly recommend to anyone looking for something that is soothing, adds hydration, and gives a slight dew."

I have combination skin (oily t-zone/dry everywhere else) with red, acne-prone skin. I love oats in skincare and my first product I loved with it is Aveeno’s eczema cream. It is great for irritated and dry skin. However I could only use it at night time since it is a thicker formula. This however is beautiful for daytime under sunscreen & makeup! I just give it a few minutes to absorb and it plays well. I recently had this patch of redness, bumps, and peeling, flaky skin around my nose. This slowed down the flaking and soothed the tight, dry skin. I also ended used this when I got hit with fever. You know how irritated and flaky your nose feels after 1-2 days of frequent nose blowing.. well I applied this like crazy and as a pleasant surprise I had no peeling, flaky nostrils afterwards. Also that dime sized red, flake patch with bumps? It’s gone now and I attribute this product had a large part in its disappearance.

Moving onto ingredients. It’s only 15 ingredients, the same as the Aveeno product I mentioned earlier. However, the percentage of oat ingredients is higher in Purito’s product. About 72% of this product is made up of oat while in the Aveeno it’s a combined percentage of 1. I can definitely feel this calm my skin and help relieve dryness. The relief doesn’t last long on its own though. There is no well known occlusives in this. The only ingredient that would provide occlusive properties is the oat kernel oil. Depending how many products I use in my morning routine it may be 2 to 4 hours before I feel the need to reapply. I usually just add another light moisturizer on top my drier areas and I’ll stay hydrated until night time. As for skin soothing this will calm any itchiness or dryness but on actual irritated skin it won’t right away. Applying it on my red patch it would sting momentarily when I applied this very gentle formula but it did not further irritate it. The smell of this is my favorite of all my skincare products which isn’t saying much because I go fragrance free lol. BUT it does smell like authentic oats that is slightly sweetened. Now THAT is immediately soothing and calming for me mentally. Overall if you suffer from dehydration/dryness and have very sensitive skin this will be a great emulsion to add under a thicker moisturizer."

Get this moisturizer, period, no hesitation.

I have exceptionally dry skin that gets flakey easily and it’s especially difficult to treat because it’s also acne-prone, so most ingredients in other moisturizers that are targeted towards really dry and dehydrated skin break me out. I’ve been using this and the matching oat toner and let me tell you, my skin has never felt so soft and smooth and hydrated!! It’s so glowy and it’s a noticeable difference compared to before I started using it. At the time, my skin had dry patches AND active breakouts simultaneously and anything I used to try to remedy the problem just made it so much worse, so me and my skin were s t r u g g l i n g, let me tell ya. I cannot sing enough praise for this oat line. The consistency is wonderful, it’s thick enough to provide the hydration and nourishment my skin needs but it’s not so thick that it leaves a sticky residue or just sits on my skin… it melts into my skin like butter and leaves the most beautiful naturally “lit from within” dewy finish that most moisturizers tend to promise but fall flat on. There is almost no fragrance at all except a VERY slight oat smell (as to be expected) but it’s almost completely unnoticeable. If you look at the ingredients, the list is free from anything that could potentially clog your pores or irritate your skin in any manner. I also struggle with a lot of redness, I think related to rosacea, and I’ve noticed that not only does it minimize redness because of how soothing it is, but for me personally it seems as though it prevents my skin from getting irritated to the point of redness. It’s also worth mentioning that I incorporate tretinoin into my routine as well, so my skin barrier is fragile and this moisturizer seems to have strengthened it substantially. I have searched high and low for my “perfect moisturizer” that checks all my boxes and I’m delighted to say that I’ve finally found it!! Sometimes simplicity is the best route to take."

The texture looks and feel like a lightweight lotion. Once applied, it turns into a watery, creamy emulsion consistency, as it's mostly oat water about 71%. I layered this 2-3 times after a couple of layers of toners, but for my normal/dry skin, this is not moisturizing enough. This would be better for those who are looking for an oat based emulsion, or a very light weight lotion.

The ingredients are great, and the smell is very nice- a mild oat scent. However, I wish it had more moisturizing power.

So I got this because my skin loves products with oatmeal in them and I finally decided to give it a try. The only downside of this moisturizer is that the pump isn’t amazing and that’s because the pump is really really skinny. Other than that thought, my dry skin loves and the product soaks in all the way. It has a slight dewey finish at the beginning just before before it soaks in. This products didn’t look or feel greasy/oily at all which was my biggest concern for the recipe being super super thick. One thing that got me really really excited though….was it didn’t has any silicone products in it which means some of my K Beauty sunscreens don’t pill at all with this moisturizer. This is a huge plus for me because I like my skin nice and hydrated and I can still apply K Beauty sunscreens that aren’t the most hydrating (not drying though) for my dry skin. I’ve also used this multiple times on my hands for dryness and it makes a good hand cream and again, it pairs really well with K beauty physical/mineral sunscreens
Overall-I’m very glad I purchased it and when I run out I will probably repurchase if I don’t try any other moisturizers first. I even used this on my boyfriend and he liked it a lot! He has even more dry skin than me, but it was still hydrating enough for him."

I bought it some time after Purito released it last year on Amazon. When they refer to the product as an ‘intense cream’ they really mean it. The description says it’s a ‘cream’ but it has a lotion like texture. Other than the texture, this instantly soothes my irritated skin without burning and keeps me hydrated. After application and absorption my skin feels very soft and plum with no residue after. While leaving me feeling deeply moisturized throughout the night.

Overall I would definitely recommend this cream. My skin absolutely loves this and soaks it up every time. This is a good moisturizer if you are using tretinoin or a retinoid to help keep you moisturized without worrying about dry patches. If u have sensitive skin that reacts to anything this would be perfect. It only has 15 ingredients and a majority of them contain oats. It doesn’t include any essential oils or fragrances which is a plus. You get 5oz for 21.00 which is a affordable price point for a moisturizer that should last you for quite some time. They also released an oats toner so Im definitely gonna check that out."

I use on both my face and both legs where I was experiencing a pretty bad and long (over a year) psoriasis flare up. Between using this and aquaphor on my legs, my psoriasis flare has ended. Purito just sinks into my skin and eases all itching and flakiness and moisturizes my skin in a way no lotion or cream that I have ever used has before. It is pretty rare for a lotion or cream to not irritate the psoriasis patches at all so even though this is an expensive cream once I realized the effects on my skin I just had to use it all over. Even using this over a large portion of my body (some days all of it) it has lasted me over 2 months. My face only takes a small dot and my legs each take a pump. Once my skin is damp when I put it on, which it always is, this cream spreads really well and still sinks in beautifully with only a small amount. I have tried over 20 different moisturizers on my face and this has been the best ones so far. I can use it day or night although more sparingly during the day. It has completely healed my cheeks which have been dry and chapped looking for months when no other moisturizer, hyaluronic lotion or sheet mask has made a difference. Purito and aquaphor are my winning combination head to toe. I am impatiently awaiting the arrival of my next bottle. Please please please start selling this in a bigger size!"

First and foremost, I appreciate that this cream is cruelty-free and made with vegan ingredients. As someone who values ethical and cruelty-free beauty products, this was a big selling point for me. It's great to know that I can enjoy a high-quality facial cream without compromising my values.

The texture of the cream is rich and creamy, and it applies smoothly on my skin. A little goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue. My skin feels instantly hydrated and nourished upon application.

I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall moisture level of my skin since incorporating this cream into my routine. My skin feels softer, smoother, and more plump, which is exactly what I look for in a hydrating cream. The oat-based ingredients provide a calming effect on my skin, leaving it feeling soothed and refreshed.

The packaging is sleek and hygienic, with a pump dispenser that allows for easy and controlled application. The scent of the cream is pleasant and not overpowering, which I appreciate as someone with sensitive skin.

The only reason I am giving this product a 4-star review instead of 5 is because of the price. While I find the performance of the cream to be excellent, it is on the higher end of the price range for facial creams. However, considering the quality of the ingredients and the results it delivers, I am willing to invest in this product. While it may be on the pricier side, the performance and ethical values of this cream make it a worthy investment for anyone seeking a hydrating cream with vegan ingredients."

One of the best-known benefits of oatmeal for skin is its ability to help hydrate and nourish dry skin. Skincare products containing oatmeal can help with hydrating skin, reducing skin dryness and associated symptoms such as itching, flaking, and tightness. This is especially true of colloidal oatmeal, which, when applied topically, forms an occlusive barrier on the skin, helping to prevent excessive water loss. Oatmeal also helps strengthen the skin's natural moisture barrier while keeping your skin well-hydrated and helps protect your skin’s natural moisture barrier.

This facial cream has a light creamy texture on it. It is easily absorb by the skin but leaves the skin a bit wet. It nevertheless leave the skin smooth and soft.

In the meantime I switched to a Beta-Glucan serum, but I think I’ll permanently make the switch only due to the absolutely horrible pump of this Oat-In moisturizer. If you’re set on using this product as it’s the only oat-based moisturizer that doesn’t contain other known irritants, read on…

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

I have Sahara-dry skin with rosacea, plus a mast-cell disorder which causes regular skin inflammation and severe flushing. With that, this gel-cream moisturizer is a fantastic addition to my routine!

With the crappy pump, I use 20-25 pumps (teeny, minuscule squirts—imagine a dropper bottle but only about an eighth of the product actually comes out of the full dropper. It’s *that* level of annoyance) to cover my face, neck, and upper chest.

I can see this being a great standalone moisturizer for someone with oily skin, but for someone with dry skin, expect to use it in addition to a heavier moisturizer to ensure proper skin barrier maintenance.

It’s a great, simple-ingredient, creamy, light moisturizer with wonderful calming benefits that anyone can use.

To note: I can’t consume oats (I’m also a Celiac, and the avenins in oats trigger an immune response in me similar to the way it responds to gluten), but I benefit greatly from topical application. As long as you don’t have a contact allergy, this seriously will work for anyone.

Hope this helps!

Oh, and the last matter: The bottle is designed to be easily recyclable with no label adhered to it. I love the design and concept! But it does arrive naked in an Amazon package—meaning no recyclable box or anything protecting the bottle from germs.

This is my second purchase of this moisturizer, and I just wash the bottle in cold water with a mild soap so I don’t accidentally smear everything it’s come in contact with on my face—not a big deal. But what annoyed me was Amazon putting its product label sticker on the second bottle…. I can’t get that sucker off! The ink certainly got all over my hands while trying, though. So, I just cold-washed it like the previous bottle. The ink came right off, and I was able to peel about half the label off too. But Amazon putting a sticker on the bottle eliminates Purito’s packaging goal so…. Just thought I’d give you a head’s up."

I like it so far. It’s thick and moisturizing. I think the reason it’s so expensive is because it claims to be vegan and made with oats and natural ingredients.

I used Purito's Oat-In Gel Cream in the summer months as a last step, which has an extremely light watery texture. But for winter when the air is dryer, I wanted something more occlusive.

I first tried Krave's Oat So Simple, which I would describe as a ""lightweight lotion."" I really liked it and would use it again, but it still wasn't quite heavy enough for winter for me. When applied at night, I would wake up with my face completely dry.

So now I've decided to try Purito's Oat-in Intense Cream. It was lighter than I expected it to be - I would describe this as a ""light lotion"" too, but it is a tad more occlusive than the Krave due to the addition of oat kernel oil, which keeps it from completely absorbing/drying down (ideal for winter). It's definitely not anywhere near a heavy night cream, but layered over a toner, active, and serum, it's been working well for me in winter. It probably wouldn't be enough on its own, especially if you have dry skin. I'll probably pair it with Purito's sleeping pack a few times a week for an added moisture boost.

It hasn't broken me out, and I love that it's fragrance-free with a fairly simple ingredient list (it only smells like oatmeal when you first apply it, which I find pleasant).

I also really like that it didn't come in a box or other unnecessary packaging, and that the label is embossed right into the bottle. It did come with a little cap over the pump which will be nice for travel so it doesn't accidentally dispense in my bag. Other brands could take note on that!

Overall, I'll definitely finish up this bottle but might look for something a bit more heavy next winter season instead."

It's a really nice, big bottle too, and it doesn't take much at all, so I expect the bottle will last quite awhile. Certainly long enough to get your money's worth. Great for nighttime use."

There's no bothersome smell or anything like that.

The package for it is a bit strange - it's a bottle with a little paper thing hung over the neck of it. To read the ingredients and such, you'd probably have to tear it off, because a bunch of the information is on the inside of the folded paper. I think the packaging should be fixed, because if someone needs to check for ingredients they might be allergic to, they'd pretty much have to take off the label to do it, or hold it open and try to uncomfortably read it.

It pumps out in a tiny little stream but you don't need too much to spread it on your face, and it spreads pretty easily.

I think, overall, it works out fine for a facial cream."

There is barely any scent to the cream at all, which is great - I'm always happy to see a company investing their energy into the effectiveness of a product rather than the peripheral stuff like scent and color.

It's soothing, especially if your skin is going through weak skin barrier issues that makes it sting with other face products - this cream doesn't exacerbate any redness or stinging. The only thing is that it gave me a few white heads in my chin area where I get acne, but it wasn't a huge deal and they went away after a few uses, it never actually broke me out or made my active acne worse.

I really dislike the pump. It took A LOT of work to get the lotion to dispense from the pump the first time and it seems to resist traveling through the tiny tube attached to the nozzle. Otherwise, I do like the glass bottle and the cap the comes on the pump.

I use this right after toning or after a shower. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and there is almost a little bit of a tacky feel. I use it in the morning before sunscreen as well and have had no issues with pilling.

It’s safe to say I own the majority of each line from purito. The moisturizers are perfection.

This one is in a 5.07 Oz pump bottle for $21!! And it goes on your face/neck this product at that price is a STEAL!
The texture comes out white and fluffy, and then once you touch it to your skin it literally melts in almost like a gel would but without the gel feeling. Definitely a cream. It has the perfect amount of slip to it which I’ve come to expect from all puritos moisturizers and I love that because the feeling on your skin is like silk. It doesn’t pill. I put it over several products in my routine like my serums/essence, and it just glides on like butter!
I layered this UNDER my tretinoin since the winter dries my skin out terribly I cannot NOT use a moisturizer and a few serums first and all of puritos moisturizer aide very well in that slip that I need to put tretinoin and hydroquinone treatments on, without it they always pill. With all purito moisturizers it’s like it stops it from pulling which is my biggest pet peeve.

Ok so ingredients are perfect 🤩 I wasn’t expecting such a luxury feeling to this with the ingredient deck but was pleasantly surprised. My skin has been red lately from the Midwest weather combined with mild rosacea and this definitely felt very soothing and comfortable.

I used it over Niod Modulating glucosides followed by tretinoin and then HQ. Wait about 5-10 min before applying actives like RetinA on top of moisturizers to get better absorption and less chance of pilling. I notice if I don’t wait long enough between steps most moisturizers will pull when putting rx ontop. This one doesn’t.
The packaging is FANTASTIC! Such little waste 100% recyclable didn’t come in a box it just had a cap over the pump lid thing and a piece of paper which I thoroughly appreciate! The skincare industry creates billions of pounds in waste each year and I do not like to be one that contributes to that.
I will be buying the rice silky toner now since this is such a hit!
I wore this all day as well from morning til about 11pm and I kept touching my face because it was so smooth literally 10 hours and none of the moisture when away. 5 stars and quickly moving to the top of my list as a holy grail. Zero irritation and a lot of moisturizers like cereve etc sting my skin a little bit.
Another one from purito I highly recommend is the dermide sleep mask. It’s amazing for irritated akin. A little foes a long way! I enjoy the purito dermide balm as well and the one in the blue pump bottle but I cannot think of the name.

Just buy this! It’s almost like 3 bottles of a US moisturizer in one container at 5.07 Oz when they normally come in 1.67 Oz and at $21 that’s a freaking STEAL of a deal.

Ok I’ll stop fangirling over this now. If I have any updates I will update. I always do. If this helped you out at all be sure to like it!"

I didn't know what to expect from this formula but am always down to try new KBeauty products, and Purito is a classic K Beauty brand.

I came back from a week-long vacation after having fun (not eating well) and with a couple stressful travel days to my skin on the verge of breaking out all over. Mask wearing on a full day of airport and air travel, my vacation diet, and general stress had resulted in the beginnings of several breakouts. I used this serum my first night back home, and woke up to significantly less emerging bumps. Within two nights of use, there were no more spots threatening to turn into pimples or breakouts.

The serum feels very lightweight going on, sinks right into the skin. No pilling or stickiness, and it went well under my moisturizer. It has little to no scent to it, which I prefer. No stinging or irritation when I put this on, which is not always the case with acid exfoliants / skin clearing serums in my experience. Is not moisturizing by itself, but I always layer a moisturizer as a final step in my routine anyway so I'm not upset by that.

This is now my go-to if my skin is stressed / looking like breakouts are starting!"

It’s not oily, and I don’t really notice a smell. It does leave my skin a little tacky feeling, but that seems to keep my makeup looking fresh all day.

Das heißt, Produkt welches sich sonst außerhalb auf die Pipette legen würde, wird abgestriffen und nicht mit der Luft kontaminiert. Zweiter Pluspunkt ist, dass es angenehm, bis kaum riecht. Die Konsistenz ist wie ein kleines bisschen gelartig, welches sich sehr gut verteilen lässt und bei meiner Mischhaut sehr schnell einzieht. Daeine Haut nicht nur gemischt, sondern auch sehr empfindlich ist, wäre hier schon der erste Zeitpunkt an dem ich etwas Unangenehmes spüren hätte können. Aber nein, das Hautgefühl blieb angenehm, welches auch so blieb. Hatte schon Produkte von anderen Marken, die nach einer Weile das Jucken, Spannen oder Brennen anfingen. Check 2 also auch bestanden. Am nächsten Morgen ein Blick in den Spiegel, meine Haut 50, glänzte leicht und fühlte sich sehr gut an. Keine roten Stellen, keine Pickelchen etc. Das kann natürlich auch ein Zufall sein und ich mich in einem hormonellen guten Zustand befinden. Aber ich denke, dass es schon auch an dem Produkt liegen kann, dass keine Reizung über Nacht erfolgte. Sollte sich langfristig etwas zum Negativen verändern, werde ich es berichten. Bis hierher erstmal volle Punktzahl 💪👍 Ich freue mich sehr darüber.

I've been trying to use it daily, usually in the evening and I have found my breakouts have calmed a little although that could also be down to my hormone levels as they have a tendency to fluctuate anyway causing them to come and go.
It is scent-free and is a really nice serum to use. I'm quite happy to continue with this product and hope it will help to clarify my skin the longer I use it. A strong 4/5 from me."

Known for its antioxidant properties, noni fruit extract helps to protect the skin against environmental stressors, while promoting a healthy and radiant complexion. I noticed a visible improvement in the overall clarity and brightness of my skin after just a few weeks of consistent use.

What sets the PURITO Clear Code Superfruit Serum apart is its non-irritating formula. Many clarifying solutions in the market tend to be harsh and drying. However, this serum strikes the perfect balance by effectively clarifying the skin without causing any dryness or irritation. It's a relief to find a product that tackles blemishes and congestion without compromising the skin's natural moisture barrier.

Furthermore, as a conscious consumer, I appreciate PURITO's commitment to being vegan and cruelty-free. Knowing that this serum is ethically produced and free from animal-derived ingredients gives me peace of mind when using it.

The packaging of the PURITO Clear Code Superfruit Serum is sleek and functional, with a convenient pipette dispenser that ensures hygienic and mess-free application. The lightweight texture of the serum absorbs quickly into the skin, making it suitable for both morning and evening use. I found that it layers well with other products in my routine and doesn't leave any greasy or sticky residue."

This serum is aimed at targeting excessive oil, redness and acne. Whilst I do not have acne, I do occasionally get redness and oily skin, so I thought incorporating a clarifying solution into my skincare may help these issues.

So far, in the time I've been testing it out, I have noticed one thing in particular - it breaks me out! I don't want this to put anyone off purchasing, but it's the truth - it's a clarifier, so I fully anticipated this, so I'm not shocked. It hasn't been a horrendous amount of acne, with that said - just a few pimples here and there which are going away with the help of some spot cream and hydrocolloid patches.

Keep in mind that most clarifiers work by 'purging' the skin initially, so this brings to the surface any acne or issues that were hiding out of sight. The good news is, once that stage is over, it doesn't happen again so long as you continue with the serum. (If you stop, you have to go through the purging stage all over again in the future, so it's best to just stick with it and allow the serum to do it's job, then reap the benefits along the line.)

With all that said, I am still too early in the game to notice any difference in oil or redness as my skin is still purging, but as I've had good results with another PURITO serum (one aimed at hydration), I'm hopeful for the future.

Lastly, the serum and brand is Vegan and cruelty free, so I can use it with a clear conscience! The price at the time this review was written was £18.36."

I use facial wash to remove the chlorine at the pool and then some form of serum on my skin as an extra pick me up after the chlorine and the shower!

This regime works well for me, the rest of the time, the only other thing I apply is a night cream of some sort.

My skin is not sensitive and can tolerate most things. I had no adverse reaction to this. The consistency is a little sticky, but it does soak in with a little patience.

My skin felt very soft after using the superfoaming cleanser and the serum in tandem.

Noni fruit is a tropical fruit from Asia!

Purito's Clear Code Superfruit Serum is a next-generation, next level rebalancing serum designed to address the root causes of blemishes, clogged pores, excessively oily skin.

Vegan and cruelty-free, this 30ml serum - a fresh green in colour - arrives in an FSC-certified box printed with soy ink. It's packaged in a compactly sized frosted dropper bottle that looks stylish and makes it easy to use. The product I received has a long 19.06.2026 expiry date.

Unfragranced, it needs to be applied - just 2-3 drops - after cleanser and toner if you use it, patting to aid absorption. It applies very easily, leaving no residue or greasiness, just a feeling of intense hydration.

Where's the innovation? - This is a Superfruit Serum that contains Noni Fruit Extract and Succinic Acid. Noni fruit has been used for centuries in Polynesian cultures and appears to have wide health benefits, which include anti-inflammatory properties. Succinic acid is an established skincare ingredient with anti-oxidant properties that can help with ageing, scarring and getting rid of dead skin cells.

Tip: Don't skip days. Consistency keeps the breakouts away.

Easy to use: One pump does the job.
Gentle: Good for sensitive and acne-prone skin.
Effective: Noticed fewer red spots.

The formula is very gentle, making it suitable for those with sensitive skin or those prone to redness and inflammation. I found that it effectively removed dirt, excess oil, and impurities from my skin without leaving it feeling tight or stripped. Instead, my skin felt refreshed and balanced after each use.

The inclusion of Noni Fruit Extract in the formula is a notable highlight. Noni Fruit is known for its antioxidant properties, which help protect the skin against environmental stressors and free radicals. This ingredient also aids in brightening the complexion and promoting a more youthful appearance. I noticed that my skin looked more radiant and healthier after incorporating this cleanser into my skincare routine.

For those who value ethical skincare, PURITO Clear Code Superfruit Cleanser is a fantastic choice. It is vegan and cruelty-free, meaning it is not tested on animals and does not contain any animal-derived ingredients. This aligns with the growing trend of conscious consumerism and makes it a great option for individuals who prefer products that are both effective and ethically produced.

The PURITO Clear Code Superfruit Cleanser comes in a sleek and minimalistic bottle, which is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical for everyday use. The 150ml / 5.07 fl. oz. size ensures that the product lasts for a considerable period, offering good value for money. A little goes a long way, so you don't need to use a large amount of product for each cleanse."

Not only does it work wonders for my complexion, but it also doesn't leave my skin feeling dry or uncomfortable like some other foam cleansers I've tried in the past.

First off, the packaging is very lovely. It's quite beautiful, and the bottle pumps effortlessly.

The first time I used it, I did the recommended 2-3 pumps, I found that to be waaay too harsh for me. It left my skin very dry and flakey.

The next day I did only ONE pump instead, I found that to be a lot better. It cleansed my face without completely drying it out.

There isn't really much of a smell, but when you do get a hint of it, it's more of that acid/sterilized smell. But Heaven forbid you accidentally get a tiny bit on your lips or mouth. Jeez, it's absolutely horrendous.

All in all, it's okay. I've had others that worked better with my skin. I just find this one to be on the harsher side. But I'll keep using it and experimenting with it, I'll probably try using half a pump for my face."

This is a foam cleanser, that lathers well and has slight/no fragrance. What I noticed is that the cleanser is mild, and does not strip all the oil from your face, which is definitely a good thing. However, it does leave a squeaky or shiny texture after wash, and leaves a residue (maybe?) which I'm not a big fan of.

I have used this foaming superfruit cleanser for 3 days. I did a couple of simple patch tests first, first on my hand, then on a small area of my face and then all over.

It is a very easy one to use, a pump or two and the foam can be easily distributed to your face, gentle spread over and rubbed in and then rinsed off. Foaming washes are so much easier to use, especially if like me you take them to the swimming pool and use them after swimming. It is great that this is non-irratating as the chlorine does dry my skin out.

I followed it up with the superfruit serum from the same supplier/manufacturer and it was equally as good.

I should say I have fairly normal skin, slightly oil t zone, the rest is normal to dry depending on the weather etc. I do not have sensitive skin or skin that is fussy, so I was expecting this to be okay and it was.

I would be happy to recommend both, but I would always advocate doing small patch tests to prevent issues particularly if you have had reactions in the past.

My skin really felt lovely when I got home, not at all dry or tight from the chlorine!"

I’ve really enjoyed using this so far. It’s gentle but still gets my skin clean and soft, especially on those days when I want a deep cleanse. I've found my skin is much clearer and softer when using this, compared to some of my other cleansers. I’ve got combo skin that’s sensitive but this doesn’t strip my skin or leave it irritated. Definitely recommend this cleanser. I also use the serum from the same range and both work great together."

Since it's a balm and not a regular cleanser, it leaves your face feeling hydrated.

This one works! I've never used a balm-type cleanser before, just liquid oils. This is much less messy as there is nothing to drip. It got foundation, mascara, eye shadow, and eyebrow pencil off without any issue. It feels great to massage it in my skin and then laying a warm washcloth on top to wipe off the excess is a relaxing way to end the day. It got all of the eye makeup off, too, working much better than my usual go-to of petroleum jelly. It did not leave a greasy residue afterwards nor need excessive wiping or scrubbing to remove.

My skin felt silky smooth and soft afterwards, and not dry or tight. Usually I need to apply moisturizer shortly after cleansing because my skin just feels so tight but this was really pleasant.

It is unscented and kind of smells like vegetable oil. Not my favorite, but fortunately it does not leave any aroma behind once wiped off. Highly recommended for sensitive and dry skin!"

The balm is solid in the jar - much akin to coconut oil - you get it firm and then it softens - this is the same.

Love the little scoop that is included in the package. So much easier to apply - now It wont get under my nails. Boom! Bonus.

When you first apply - you will notice that there is no odor - the second thing you will notice is that it seems very oily - which immediately put me off. But dont worry about this - its very hard to describe - but it starts off oily - naturally its avocado - but then suddenly it isn't .

A little disappointed that I cannot see all the ingredients anywhere - just pictures of broccoli, avocado - what seems to be parsley/kale? and cabbage?

Regardless - it felt gorgeous on my skin - removed all my make up and did not feel oily after

I didn't know if you had to wash or wipe off - so I did a googly - work into the face for 60 seconds - rinse with warm water sever times to remove make up or dirt - then wipe with a towel

very very happy with this"

I used this a good few times however, I have recently had lash extensions put on and my technician told me to avoid any oily facial washes as they can make the lashes drop out, so I have taken a break from using it again until they are off.

The balm itself is really easy to use. You simply need to scoop a bit out using the provided spatula, rub it between your fingers until it melts and softens before massaging it in circular motions all over your face. I then wash mine off with a flannel and warm water. The result (after toning and moisturising) is soft, cleansed skin.

At the time of this review, there was no price showing so I can't comment if it is good value but I can recommend it for doing what it is supposed to. 4/5"

I tend to remove my eye make up with a smidge of jojoba oil and then go in with this to clean my face. I can hardly detect a scent which is ideal for people with sensitive skin. The balm contains avocado oil, watermelon seed and baobab oil. It also contains extracts of kale, Spinach, Broccoli, mugwort and cabbage leaf. I would definitely reach for this balm again."

Smells great but if I can't use it on my eyes it's not something I would repurchase."

It is confusing as the pictures in the description seem to show it being taken right up to the eye area.

There isn't much smell to the product which is probably a bonus to those with sensitive skin, but personally, I like some perfume. I love that it is packed with ingredients to encourage healthy skin and it certainly leaves your skin feeling moisturised and mine is particularly dry.

I think this is a good cleanser and would happily recommend it at the price."
B0CH2PJMH8__48,B0CH2PJMH8,R3IRB673BO65SH,Reviews*,"PURITO From Green Avocado Cleansing Balm 100ml / 3.38 fl. oz., Melt-In Moisture with Avocado Oil, Vegan, Cruelty-Free, Suitable for Dry Skin, Korean Skincare","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on October 29, 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","🌟 The Purito From Green Cleansing Balm arrives boxed and comes in a 100ml recycled plastic tub with screw-on lid. The balm comes with a plastic spatula for scooping out product, and plastic top that sits on top of the balm to hold the spatula.

➕️ As an MUA I've been using balms for years as I find them the most effective for removing makeup whilst also cleansing the skin, which is important for me as I can do quite heavy makeup looks for pictures which requires a lot of removal afterwards! I normally use the Elemis balm but always open to trying others!
➕️ The Purito balm comes in very simplistic, green packaging. It's made from recycled materials and the balm is vegan friendly/cruelty free
➕️ The balm itself appears to be fragrance free (I can't pick up any smell from it). The balm appears solid until you scoop some of it out, then it basically melts like butter. The balm feels both silky and oily between the fingers, and spreads onto the face with absolute ease. With these balms, you want to massage it onto your face for a good thirty seconds and then add and combine a tiny bit of water to the face and blend it all again. From there, you can either use cotton pads or a face cloth to wipe the balm and all your makeup off, or you can wash it off with warm water.
➕️ I normally wash it off however sometimes I'll also just wipe it all away with a micro fibre face cloth.
Although the balm feels oily between the fingers, it doesn't leave your skin feeling oily and greasy after it's all wiped/washed away, so it's suitable for oily skin too. I find this balm really effective whilst also gentle enough to rub into my eyes to remove eye makeup, which you can't always do with some balms as it stings and irritates the eyes. The balm removes all traces of makeup with relative ease, leaving the skin feeling soft and cleansed.
➕️ This specific balm is actually made in Korea, known for making great skincare products. The balm includes ingredients such as, watermelon seed oil, avocado oil, spinach leaf extract, cabbage leaf extract and more, so it's packed with lots of healthy green ingredients for the skin.

🌟 Overall I've found this balm fab for removing all traces of heavy makeup, including on the eyes. It's both very effective and gentle. It glides on like a butter and leaves the skin feeling as though it's fresh as a daisy. After using daily for a couple of weeks, I haven't had any breakouts nor irritation on my skin. It also doesn't feel oily/greasy nor dried out. Definitely does the same quality of job as Elemis, however I think the only thing lacking for me in comparison is a nice fragrance!"

I used it the same way I would any other cleansing balm. It comes with a small plastic spatula but I prefer to use my fingers. I apply a small amount directly to my dry face and rub. The balm instantly starts melting my makeup away while I rub it in. I then use a damp cloth to wipe the balm and makeup away. I don’t rinse as I don’t feel I need to with balms. This one doesn’t leave any greasy residue and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.

I never use cleansing balms to remove eye makeup as they tend to get in my eyes and make my vision blurry for a few minutes which I prefer to avoid. Instead, I use micellar water.

This balm has a slightly artificial scent which I’m not a huge fan of but it is faint so it certainly doesn’t put me off using it.

It performs as well as other well known brands of cleansing balm so I’m happy to recommend 😊"

At first it looks solid but as soon as you put your finger in it you'll see that it's super buttery.

Really easy to apply and gives me the squeaky clean feeling I'd usually only be able to get when scrubbing my face with a face wash. Easily melts makeup or dirt without the slightest tug or pull and leaves my skin feeling super soft.

The texture is amazing. It starts off as a fairly balmy consistency and it melts almost instantly when it gets into contact with the skin. A bit of water will them emulsify it as you rub. Rinses off quicker than any face wash or scrub I've tried.

It doesn't leave behind an oily or tacky residue either. I usually need to use a moisturiser after cleansing because my face would feel a bit dehydrated, but not with this.

One of my favourite steps in my skincare routine at the moment and I'm certain I'll be back for more. I'd highly recommend."

I love trying/using new K-Beauty products, as they are leaps ahead in the skincare game. One of the main active ingredients in this formula, Centella Asiatica, is an ancient Korean herb and, a very effective/magical one at that!

This toner arrived quick, well packaged and protected with proper saftey seals (around the package and across the top of the bottle itself). It also has a clear lot # and exp date stamped on the bottle.

The formula is a clear liquid that has a thickness of a 2.5 on my thickness scale (1 being water, 10 being a rich body butter. It glides across the skin well and absorbs super quick. Usually I stay away from scented products, but while this is 'scented' it isn't artificially fragranced. The 'scent' comes from all the wonderful extracts in the formula. This smells super fresh, clean and a bit spa like. I get a lot of earl gray tea too, probably from the bergamot. I absolutely LOVE how this smells and I honestly want to bathe in it. While it is delicious, the 'scent' isn't overpowering or nauseating at all.

They are not kidding when they claim this instantly soothes the skin! I'm literally amazed that even the worst, most inflamed, irritated and downright painful skin conditions immediately feel better after I apply this. It is my 'go to' now after getting a peel. It feels amazing on a sunburn too. And, out of pure curiosity I tried this on mosquito bites and the dreaded poison ivy. It not only took the itch/burn away immediately, but this helps heal any/all skin issues much quicker than anything else I've used. This formula is also a lifesaver when I have an event to go to and I have blemishes or uneven skin.

Not only is this soothing, it's incredibly hydrating too! Even when my skin isn't bad, I'll use this toner just because I love how soft, plump and bouncy it leaves my face.

I just came back to purchase my second bottle of this miracle toner and leave my review. This has definitely been an absolute skin saver /miracle product so far this summer and I don't really know what I would do without it at this point.

I actually forgot how much this cost, but I figured/planned to spend around $30-$35. I was STUNNED when I realized that this is no where near that price! (Even if this was $40, I would buy it and it would be worth every dollar!) At $16 a bottle (which is generously sized) you can't go wrong! If you have sensative skin, get rashes, bites, sunburn, eczema, get chemical peels or ANY other issue that irritates your skin- you NEED this product!"

However this product doesn’t cause any issues. It’s fine. I’m going to continue to use it twice daily but I don’t think I’ll repurchase it, but that’s probably because I don’t think I find the toner step necessary.
But no issues with the actual product just personal preference.

Updated Review: I repurchased this. This is so good for sensitive skin. It feels like nothing which lead me to believe it wasn’t good. But after using another gentle toner I realized this one was way better for me. I’ll continue to use this. I also put it on top of skin that was inflamed on my neck and chest (along with the serum) and by morning the redness and pain was gone. Highly recommend."

This one seems unique in that it applies almost 'oily' but isn't actually oily.

It comes out in tiny droplets and applies onto your skin like the consistency of oily products, making it easier to apply than watery products. I'd normally be wary of this because that tends to lead to residue left on the skin or slow absorption. However, it dried almost immediately and left zero residue. No oily feeling, no stickiness.

It also is virtually scentless unless you are directly sniffing the product from the bottle. I prefer scentless products, so this is a big plus for me. I also have sensitive skin and notice zero redness or itchiness after using this product.

I think I may have found a new favorite toner. Fast absorption, easy application, scentless, no residue, and no sensitivity issues."

Makes my skin feel moister than most. It is also a little bit thicker than water, so I imagine that contributes to it. It is excellent in reducing irritation, before I switched to Korean products, I found that cheaper store bought toner would leave some parts of my face itchy and red sometimes. The scent is the only thing I am OK on. It refreshing in a leafy way, not a citrusy way. I also smells a bit herby, leaving me the impression that the smell is marketed toward older generations (40+ maybe?) For reference, I love nature republic product's smells.

It has a very light scent and it's one that I don't particularly care for, I know it says it doesn't but I am like a German Shepherd when it comes to fragrance. Anyway the fragrance is not nearly as strong as the box itself which really smell very strongly when I received it. It is usable to me and that's a testament to how little fragrance it has.

I think it's doing good things for my skin. What I like about toner is that it's way easier to put on than moisturizer, it doesn't seem like something that will moisturize but it really does, when I use it I never have dry flaky skin later in the day."

This is a fantastic toner.

I’m a huge fan of K-beauty. This is no exception. I’d call this an essence rather than a toner. It’s so great. Once your face is clean and exfoliated you should pour a little in your hand and pat it all over your skin leaving your skin wet. Then apply your serums directly onto the wet toner and skin. This will create a delivery system to transport your serums deeper into the skin. Then apply your creams and sealants.

I find this to be an extremely high quality toner at an excellent value. It smells great. It soothes the skin and delivers all other products beautifully and seamlessly.

Despite that, it's not sticky and left my skin feeling very smooth after it absorbed into my face. :) I found absorption time was around ten minutes.

I liked the scent and felt as if it smelled almost fresh. This does have added fragrance so if you hate smells in your skincare or are sensitive, look elsewhere. For me, it doesn't bother me as I love fragrance in my skincare. You may want to perform a patch test if you are unsure just in case.

Using it for over a week, I do notice less red blotchy areas. This is due to the primary centella ingredient which is known to soothe skin and help with hydration issues. Other hero ingredients are allantoin, Arginine, and rose flower oil. It's a nice formulation with Centella as the primary focus. :) I like how smooth my skin is and the texture has improved from the hydration this toner adds to my skin.

I think if you're looking for a Centella toner and don't mind fragrance, this is really nice because of how good it smells and the fact that Centella is the primary ingredient in this toner."

I think that the price is reasonable, especially at it's current price of around $15.90 (at least, in my personal opinion). I'd definitely order this again, as it works great and feels great too! ❤️"

What I don’t love is that there’s a slight tackiness to my skin that it leaves behind. It’s not a dealbreaker though. And if you put other products/makeup over it, it’s not an issue at all.

For about $16 at the time of this review, I think it’s a fair price. Made in Korea. The expiration date on the bottle I got is March, 2027.

This is a really lovely toner. I'm currently a tretinoin user which can make my skin peel like a snake but also be sensitive and irritable at times. This has helped soothe that irritation nicely without causing my skin to get more angry.
This is one of those products you use and think, ""Oh, that's how they get glass skin!""
I think this product would be lovely after spending time in the sun, too. Centella is like Asia's aloe. If you spend a lot of time in the sun or just live in a brutal environment, this could be a nice addition.

I love to use a toner after cleansing to make sure I get every last bit of makeup and soap off my face before moisturizing.

The bottle is stiff and is the kind where you have to kind of shake the bottle like it’s hot sauce or soy sauce onto your cotton pad. That sounds weird but you can’t squeeze the bottle and it doesn’t come out very well when you just turn it upside down, so gently shaking the liquid out works fine. The formula is more like gel than any other toner I’ve tried. It was a thicker consistency. Maybe that’s why my face felt so moisturized after I used it. No tightening at all. My face is so much softer than normal. I have not noticed any redness or irritation since using the product.

Of all the products I’ve tried to give the ‘glass skin’ effect, this one is the best. I didn’t expect the consistency to be thick like an essence but it’s so effective that I don’t mind at all. Since it’s so thick I can even skip the essence step on days when I’m feeling lazy and it’s so good that I don’t miss the essence anyway!
+ on days when I apply a bit more (if my skin is inflamed or I’m going to be in a dry environment) my skin still absorbs all of it and it never feels sticky. In my opinion it also helps whatever I use on top of it sink into my skin better. I will be repurchasing!"

Mit Hautpflegeprodukten aus Korea habe ich allerdings schon gute Erfahrungen gemacht, sodass ich den Toner bestellt habe.

Der Toner ist in einer schlichten, aber schicken Flasche enthalten, die sehr wertig wirkt. Ich war überrascht, dass der Toner relativ dicklich ist. Sowas kannte ich bislang noch nicht. Man muss also ein bisschen drücken, um genug Produkt entnehmen zu können. Toll finde ich, dass der Toner keinen Geruch hat. Auch fühlt sich die Haut nach dem Einziehen glatt und gepflegt an, ohne das Rückstände verbleiben. Mir gefällt das Produkt sehr gut und ich vergebe 5 Sterne."

I loved how quickly I felt refreshed, how there was no stickiness or weight, and how hydrated I felt. Its consistency is a little thicker, yet it absorbs well into the skin.

Der Toner wird in einer Flasche geliefert, die eine hygienische Entnahme und genaue Dosierung ermöglicht. Es reichen bereits wenige Tropfen für eine Anwendung im Gesicht und am Hals. Daher reicht die enthaltene Menge für einen sehr langen Zeitraum aus.
Die Konsistenz ist nicht so wässrig wie bei typischen Gesichtswassern, sondern ähnelt eher einem gelartigem Serum. Daher lässt sich der Toner am besten auftragen, indem man einige Tropfen auf den Handrücken tröpfelt und diese dann mit den Fingern ins Gesicht einarbeitet.
Anfangs wirkt der Toner etwas klebrig, aber er zieht relativ schnell ein und dann vergeht auch das klebrige Hautgefühl. Die Haut fühlt sich nach der Anwendung erfrischt und gepflegt an.
Obwohl ich eine sehr sensible Haut habe, konnte ich keinerlei Hautirritationen wie Juckreiz, Trockenheit oder Spannungen feststellen.

Insgesamt hat mich der Toner sowohl optisch als auch qualitativ überzeugt. Er bietet eine tolle Pflegewirkung und verbessert das Hautbild schon nach wenigen Anwendungen sichtbar.
Den Preis empfinde ich jedoch als überteuert. Daher ziehe ich einen Stern ab."

Gotu Kola is an herb in the parsley family, with a long history of use in the traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine systems. This herb contains certain chemicals that seem to decrease swelling and blood pressure. People use it to treat burns, poor circulation and varicose veins. It is also used for scars, stretch marks, and many other skin conditions and it seems to increase collagen production, which might be helpful for wound healing."

Quality: excellent - Made in the Korea, known for strict cosmetics regulations
Usage: excellent - Nice and hydrating, a little goes a long way

Note: Given the lack of testing requirements for cosmetics, and the often unsubstantiated claims for efficacy, I typically evaluate them based primarily on ingredients and quality. Although I may reference my personal experience, there are simply too many individual variables to determine how it’ll work on each person. Prices can fluctuate, so I usually leave it to the buyer to determine value."

The cream itself is a nice consistency, and does well to saturate into the skin. I find it has good moisturizing properties, and as such would probably contribute to the reduction of fine lines, and the crows feet type of effect you get at the corner of your eye. As far as reducing the signs of under eye discoloration or bags, I never noticed any difference in myself personally with any eye cream that I have ever tried, and that includes this one. I don't think that is something that can be changed with a cream, and would likely need surgical intervention for it to happen. So, for eye creams I have tempered my expectations due to this experience. As long as the eye cream does a good job in hydrating my skin, I would consider it a successful one. This eye cream does saturate nicely like I mentioned before, and hydrates well. It is also completely scentless which is important to me. That being said, I don't think I've ever had an eye cream that was scented. One very peculiar thing I have to mention however, is that I developed a small pimple close to the corner of my eye, which I have literally never had happened before. I don't know if this cream has something to do with that, or if it's just coincidence, but I figured it deserved mentioning. It is so out of the ordinary, that I couldn't even believe it. Again, I'm not saying this cream is responsible, but it did happen to me after I started using it. Other than that, it's fine under eye cream, and has good moisturizing properties. Time will tell how well it works over a longer extended period, but my initial impressions are decent."

It has a slight cooling effect that feels great on my skin when applied in the morning. Centella seems to be the main ingredient but there are a host of other good ingredients such as camellia, meadowfoam seed oil, ceramide NP, and shea butter! It wore well under makeup and left my dark circles looking much brighter and less prominent over the course of the week. :)

I think people should be aware there is added fragrance and Macadamia oil in this product. If you are sensitive to smells or allergic to tree nuts, this is not the product for you. This didn't affect my experience but I know it may affect the experience of many others.

Overall, this is a luxury eye cream that feels great and cooling on hot summer days as a little goes a long way. You won't have any issues wearing makeup over this eye cream and it can even act as a primer of sorts as I found my eyeshadow layered well over it because of the somewhat grippy smooth texture of the eye cream.

My obsession with K-Beauty keeps getting stronger, as these products are amazing- this eye cream being no exception.

The product arrived quickly, in a quality box that was sealed on both ends with a tamper proof seal (one with a QR code). The box has a clear lot # and expiration date (12/19/26) printed on the side. Inside, the easy squeeze tube also has a saftey seal covering the product opening as well as the matching lot # imprinted in the ridge of the plastic. This is definitely, without a doubt a legitimate product.

The formula itself is opaque white and has a thickness/density of a 6 on my thickness scale (1 being water, 10 being a rich body butter). It pats into the skin beautifully and absorbs well. Fragrance is thankfully NOT an ingredient that is included in this formulation, however the natural extracts do lend a wonderful, fresh and clean scent to the product. (This might be my favorite smell of any skincare product- ever!)

As the formula is absorbed into the skin, the delicate eye area immediately begins to feel softer. After just a few minutes, the skin even looks plumper and more filled out. I'm amazed that, minutes after my very first use, I could see very visable changes happening before my eyes. I've never had a product that got to work so quickly. The future definitely was promising!

Usually, I won't write a skincare product review after just a few weeks of use, as I feel it is too early to really notice any visible results. But this product product broke all the rules! Just a few weeks in and my eye bags have gone from terrible to null. I honestly looked like I hadn't slept in years and could haunt a house, but every day the bags got better, my dark circles improved and my skin got tighter, firmer and bounced right back every time I dabbed this game changing, holy grail product on.
Now, I'm not sure if the fuller, more hydrated skin is choking out the fine lines under my eyes or if the formula is erasing them all together. Either way, they are pretty much invisible now and this is the only thing I've changed in my routine.

I would expect a product like this, with an incredible and powerful ingredient line up and one that's SUPER effective to cost upwards of $50. And knowing what I know now (how well it works), I would happily pay it too! But the fact that this is LESS than $20 literally blows my mind.

Will I buy this again?
I already have! I bought 3 total, 2 for me and 1 for my mother. I'll continue to use/buy it too! This is, without a doubt, a holy grail product!"

While it’s a common ingredient in skin care products for a long time, it has really taken off recently thanks to K-Beauty products like PURITO SEOUL. PURITO SEOUL Wonder Releaf Centella Eye Cream does a good job at soothing the skin and boosting elasticity around the eyes. The results are less redness, less noticeable fine lines and less puffiness. The scent reminds me of a mountain spa retreat. Even though it’s not fragrance free, I still find it gentle enough to be used around my sensitive eye area. I especially like how it smooths out the lines between my eyes."

È un prodotto coreano e come da manuale, nell’inci spicca la centella asiatica (ingrediente che caratterizza il brand purito), dal potere idratante e lenitivo.
Sono presenti ceramidi che contribuiscono al benessere della barriera cutanea. Punto forte sono i peptidi, fra cui peptidi biomimetici (permettono di lavorare sulle rughe d’espressione agendo sulla contrazione muscolare) e stimolanti del collagene (con effetto anti-aging).
Ho consigliato di inserirlo nella routine serale per pelle matura, anche se può essere usato su qualsiasi tipologia di pelle sia di giorno che di sera
Per potenziare gli affetti antiaging può essere associato al retinolo, come base per il contorno occhi per questo ingrediente.
L’ho provato un paio di volte e la consistenza è leggermente corposa, è risultato molto idratante."

Su objetivo es hidratar, calmar y fortalecer la piel delicada alrededor de los ojos, ayudando a reducir la apariencia de líneas finas, ojeras e hinchazón. Es una opción popular en la cosmética coreana por sus ingredientes suaves y efectivos.

Cosas a favor:
• Ingredientes naturales y seguros: La centella asiática es conocida por sus propiedades calmantes y regeneradoras. Ideal para pieles sensibles.
• Hidratación duradera: Deja la piel suave y nutrida sin sensación grasa.
• Textura ligera: Se absorbe rápidamente y no deja residuos pegajosos.
• Buena cantidad de producto: A diferencia de otras cremas de ojos, el tubo es más grande (30 ml), lo que ofrece más por el mismo precio.
• Libre de fragancias artificiales y alcohol: Reduce el riesgo de irritación.
• Efecto calmante: Alivia la hinchazón y el enrojecimiento alrededor de los ojos.

Cosas en contra:
• Resultados sutiles: No es una crema milagrosa para ojeras oscuras o bolsas muy marcadas. Los efectos son graduales.
• No tiene efecto inmediato antiarrugas: Su acción es más preventiva y de largo plazo.
• Poca corrección de color: Si buscas una crema con efecto iluminador o corrector, esta no tiene ese enfoque.
• Envase básico: Aunque funcional, el diseño del envase es simple y no destaca visualmente.

Relación calidad-precio:
La PURITO Centella Eye Cream ofrece una gran relación calidad-precio, especialmente por la cantidad de producto y la calidad de sus ingredientes. Es una excelente opción para quienes buscan hidratación y cuidado suave a largo plazo."

Meine Frau und ich haben sie nun einige Wochen getestet, und insgesamt sind wir sehr zufrieden mit den Ergebnissen.

Die Creme ist sehr leicht und zieht schnell ein, ohne einen fettigen Film zu hinterlassen. Gerade morgens, wenn es schnell gehen muss, ist das ein echter Vorteil. Meine Frau hat bemerkt, dass ihre Augenpartie nach der Anwendung glatter und frischer aussieht. Kleine Fältchen wurden etwas gemildert, und auch die typischen Schwellungen am Morgen sind weniger geworden.

Ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist, dass die Creme sehr sanft ist. Meine Frau hat empfindliche Haut, und sie hatte keinerlei Reizungen oder Unverträglichkeiten, was bei ihr leider nicht immer der Fall ist. Der enthaltene Centella-Asiatica-Extrakt wirkt beruhigend und scheint die Haut wirklich zu pflegen.

Allerdings sollte man keine Wunder über Nacht erwarten. Die Creme verbessert das Hautbild, aber natürlich braucht es regelmäßige Anwendung, um deutliche Ergebnisse zu sehen. Auch gegen sehr ausgeprägte dunkle Augenringe hilft sie nur bedingt.

Insgesamt ist die Creme aber eine sehr gute Wahl, wenn man eine leichte, gut verträgliche Pflege für die Augenpartie sucht, die sich unkompliziert in die tägliche Routine integrieren lässt. Wir vergeben daher 4 Sterne."

After using, my skin definitely feels smoother. I couldn't really tell a lot of improvement with redness, but I have a condition that is hard to treat so it's not really a fault of this product. This does have a scent that isn't too strong, but it does linger faintly for a while for those with sensitive noses.

This has 1.7061% Centella, so while you can get more concentrated products, it also has other Centella actives, like madecassic acid, asiaticoside, and asiatic acid, so it adds up to a little more. It also has niacinamide which helps improve skin in many ways and ingredients to help the skin barrier like glycerin, squalane, ceramide, palmitic acid, and phytosphingosine. The only thing keeping this from a solid 5 for me is that it has fragrance ingredients that can irritate sensitive skin, which is something that people experiencing redness should probably avoid. Otherwise, this would be a great cream."

I'm quickly realizing that Korean beauty products are made for layering. If you look at any company's line of products, the premise is you cleanse and tone, apply serum, followed by moisturizer, sunscreen, and then makeup. For that many things on the face, their products have a formulation that doesn't feel goopy. Even things that are for very dry skin. having now understood this, I think the Purito line of products is really stellar. I must admit that the products are not filled to the top of the tube which is slightly misleading."

Sometimes, hydrating creams can make me look too shiny and this is the perfect balance of dewy and hydrated that I really enjoy so I'm quite in love with this cream. :) The size is somewhat small coming in at only 50ml but you only need a quarter-sized amount for your whole face and neck.

Featuring hero ingredients such as Centella, squalane, niacinamide, and ceramide NP, this is a super soother for red blotchy areas or dry patches on my face. I think this is a great follow-up for my nightly retinoid routine as it treats a lot of those issues quickly and leaves my face looking smooth and dewy instead of angry and red. :)

This does have added fragrance but it smells really nice and dies down quickly. Fragrance haters, this is not for you. Please consult a professional for something that works for you. If you have sensitive skin, please perform a patch test before using it as with all skincare.

I think overall, this is a really great hydrating face cream and I love how it's non-greasy while still being deeply moisturising. I'll be reordering this because it smells good and makes my face feel soft."

This is a rebrand of their iconic centella cream, which is great for sensitive skin like mine (notably not conditions like eczema or rosacea. I've gone through the listing and see no mention of it being good for those conditions, so if you have them use at your own discretion). It's a rich cream, which is why I only give it 3 stars for being light weight, something I associate more with gel moisturizers and thinner creams. It spreads easily, so a little seems to go a long way. It doesn't immediately sink into the skin; I can still feel a bit of a residue 15 minutes later. But that makes sense considering that this is aimed at soothing, so longer contact time on the skin and creating a comforting barrier would help. That being said, if you have oily/combo skin this might not be a good AM moisturizer for you (or maybe save it for winter when it's cold and dry). This feels like more of a PM product due to its richness. My skin feels nice and comfortable after using this cream, like it's fully moisturized and soft. It does leave me looking dewy, which is something I know some people don't like. I do also have combo skin, so I'm prone to shine already. Overall, this delivers on its promises and I trust the brand for quality."

I bought this moisturizer because I was starting a prescription cream that contains tretinoin, and I wanted a moisturizer that was thick and very soothing.

Since starting the tretinoin cream 2 weeks ago, I have had no side effects, and I do believe this product has helped with that.

I wasn't expecting to love this product as much as I do, but its formula is just perfect - while it is very thick, a little goes a long way, and it has a non-greasy finish. My skin looked noticeably better the morning after using this moisturizer even for the first time. It brightens and evens the skin by reducing redness, and it holds in moisture much longer and more effectively than what I was using before. I also really appreciate that it's unscented.

My current routine:
- Vanicream Gentle Cleanser
- Hada Labo Gokujyun Milk
- (Prescription tretinoin cream - every other night)
- Purito Centella Cream w/ 1-2 drops rosehip seed oil

The product that this Purito cream has replaced was Holika Holika's Good Cera Emulsion, which I do still like, but even mixed with rosehip oil, I think it just isn't quite moisturizing or soothing enough to help balance my skin while introducing tret into the routine.

While it's not available on Amazon, I also recommend Purito's unscented centella sunscreen. It's lightweight, hydrating, and truly has no sunscreen smell. This brand has my trust now, and I really hope they maintain their quality standards for years to come."

Para esta reseña tomo en consideración el precio y mi experiencia con artículos similares. Suelo tener irritaciones y rojeces en el rostro ya sea por calor o frio extremo y mi piel tiende a irritarse con solo un poco de polución, en la época de primavera donde hay mucho polen mis mejillas se ponen rojas e irritadas de un minuto al otro y por eso he decidido probar esta crema y os cuento de mi experiencia con ella.

👍Lo más:

• Calma rápidamente el enrojecimiento en el rostro y es muy ligera.

👎Lo menos:

• Sin pegas.

🙋Resumen:

Mi experiencia con esta crema ha sido muy positiva, destacada a mi juicio principalmente por su textura ligera y su capacidad para calmar irritaciones cutáneas. Aunque inicialmente lo elegí para tratar enrojecimientos en la piel, he continuado usándolo por sus propiedades hidratantes. La crema se absorbe rápidamente, lo que la hace ideal para la rutina diaria sin dejar una sensación grasosa o pegajosa. Esta característica es especialmente importante para mí, ya que prefiero productos que mantengan mi piel hidratada sin añadir peso ni brillo indeseado.

Desde que descubrí esta marca, he estado gratamente sorprendida por la alta calidad de sus productos. A pesar de que es una marca relativamente nueva para mí, su enfoque en ingredientes naturales y de alta calidad se alinea perfectamente con mis preferencias personales. Me atrae especialmente su compromiso con la estética coreana, conocida por su meticulosa formulación y el uso de ingredientes beneficiosos para la piel. Este enfoque ha demostrado ser efectivo en mi experiencia, proporcionando resultados visibles y una mejora general en la textura y apariencia de mi piel.

En resumen, esta crema se ha convertido en un elemento clave en mi rutina de cuidado de la piel. No solo cumple con su función de calmar y tratar irritaciones, sino que también ofrece una hidratación duradera sin comprometer la ligereza del producto. La alta calidad y efectividad de la marca me han dejado una impresión muy positiva, y estoy emocionada por explorar más productos de su línea en el futuro. La experiencia ha sido muy satisfactoria y recomendable.

Bakuchiol is supposed to be a natural alternative to retinols. It is supposed to be a synergistic formula with the bakuchiol and hydrangea working together to smooth skin texture and improve elasticity.

I didn’t see much of a difference using this serum. Plus it smells like glue and is so thick that I have to use the dropper 3-4 times to get enough out to apply. It’s over halfway gone and now the dropper doesn’t fill completely with product. I can tell I’ll be taking the bottle apart or shaking it around to get every last bit. It’s gentle on my sensitive skin but not worth buying again."

I use it at night but my skin still looks nice and healthy in the morning, I almost don't want to wash it off lol. I haven't notice any anti-aging benefits yet since it will take more time but the plumpness and gentle formula will have me repurchasing!"

---

I'm a HUGE fan of most things Korean skincare, and the PURITO SEOUL Timeless Bloom Bakuchiol Serum is another great find. At the time of this review, it's listed at $25 with a 30% off coupon available from the seller. That's a fantastic price for such quality.

The packaging is really pretty and looks great on my vanity shelf. The serum has a light floral fragrance and feels more like a super light lotion, not oily at all. It absorbs easily into my skin. After just my first application, I noticed a significant reduction in skin redness, giving me a more even tone.

Originally, I was going to go with 4 stars, but given the price and wow factor, it's earned 5 stars."

This Korean skincare gem harnesses the power of bakuchiol, a plant-based retinol alternative, and the soothing properties of Jeju Hydrangea to deliver a potent anti-aging punch without irritating my sensitive skin. After just a few weeks of consistent use, I noticed a remarkable reduction in the appearance of those pesky fine lines, leaving my forehead smoother and more youthful-looking. The lightweight, fast-absorbing formula seamlessly integrates into my daily routine, providing a luxurious sensorial experience with its delicate floral scent.

My skin feels softer and even though I do not have significant facial wrinkles; the serum has helped my face remain smooth. I try to only use products that are all natural on my face and body which is why I am on the fence with this particular product. The first portion of ingredients are okay but getting into the second portion not so great.

What I dislike about PURITO SEOUL Bakuchiol Timeless Bloom Revitalizing Serum: The serum contains Disodium EDTA which is a chemical that stops blood from coagulating ( we use this in blood specimens in the laboratory); I feel this chemical should not be in a product that is absorbed into the skin as it can be potential harmful. I feel this product has more unnecessary chemical ingredients then I care to use along with the percentage 5.24 of improvement in elasticity is not a significant amount to make me want to continue using the product."

I’ve been using it a week and already the dropper is hard to fill with liquid. Next time I will probably order from another company. This is the second serum from a Korean skin care company that was only 25% filled. It makes me mad cause they put it in a correct size bottle from-what they advertise but short the product. Of course the bottle is opaque so you can’t see at all what is in it.

Dopo più di un mese di utilizzo (entrambe sono agli “sgoccioli”), confermo che è un’ottima accoppiata.

Questo siero dalla consistenza lattiginosa lascia la pelle molto idratata ed è idoneo anche per le pelli sensibili come la mia. Infatti, contiene l'1% di Bakuchiol, ingrediente attivo che ha le stesse proprietà del Retinolo (cioè favorisce la produzione di collagene) senza i suoi effetti collaterali, e pertanto non determina alcuna irritazione o arrossamento. Al contrario, è un estratto vegetale derivato dai semi della Psoralea Corylifolia, pianta usata nella medicina orientale proprio per le sue proprietà anti infiammatorie.
Ne consegue che il siero potenzia gli effetti positivi della crema al retinolo e, nel contempo, previene i possibili effetti negativi (sensibilizzazioni causate dall’effetto esfoliante del retinolo).

Risultato: la mia pelle è ben più liscia e levigata di un mese fa, senza aver patito alcuna controindicazione.
Lo consiglio."

Para esta reseña tomo en consideración el precio y mi experiencia con artículos similares. Este sérum esta indicado especialmente para piel sensible y delicada, es fabricado con la reconocida mundialmente estética coreana. Os cuento que he probado otros productos de PURITO SEOUL y la experiencia en general ha sido estupenda y espero seguir probando productos de ellos, porque se ajustan de forma perfecta a lo que necesita mi piel. Os cuento más.
👍Lo más:
• Sérum ideal para suavizar líneas de expresión en pieles sensibles.
👎Lo menos:
• Sin pegas.

🙋Resumen:
Mi experiencia con este sérum ha sido verdaderamente estupenda para mi piel sensible. Desde el primer uso, me di cuenta de que la fórmula es increíblemente suave y está diseñada específicamente para evitar cualquier tipo de irritación, algo que me preocupaba mucho dado que mi piel suele reaccionar a productos nuevos. El sérum tiene una textura ligera que se absorbe rápidamente, dejando mi piel con una sensación de hidratación y sin ningún residuo pegajoso. A pesar de ser suave, el sérum es sorprendentemente efectivo.

Lo que más me ha impresionado es cómo el bakuchiol y la hortensia coreana trabajan juntos en este sérum. He leído que el bakuchiol es una alternativa más suave al retinol, y puedo decir que cumple su promesa. Después de algunas semanas de uso, las líneas finas, especialmente alrededor de la boca, se han suavizado considerablemente. Además, siento que la elasticidad de mi piel ha mejorado, dándome un aspecto más firme sin causar ninguna molestia o reacción adversa.
Otra característica que me encanta de este sérum es su capacidad para aumentar la densidad de la piel. Desde que lo uso, mi piel se siente más densa y con mayor rebote, lo que le da una apariencia más saludable y llena, ya los pequeños poros abiertos en las mejillas casi no se ven. Es un placer encontrar un producto que no solo aborda las preocupaciones de envejecimiento, como las líneas finas y la falta de firmeza, sino que también está formulado teniendo en cuenta las necesidades de pieles sensibles. Estoy encantada con los resultados y es un sérum completamente recomendable.

In questo caso, questo prodotto è un mix tra un siero e una lozione. Ha una consistenza lattiginosa, è inodore e si assorbe rapidamente, lasciando la pelle incredibilmente idratata, fresca e luminosa. Avevo già utilizzato altri sieri al bakuchiol prima, e da quando lo uso ho notato che la mia pelle appare rimpolpata, con una texture migliorata e meno segni di iperpigmentazione.

Il bakuchiol è infatti l'alternativa naturale del retinolo, ha il vantaggio di non essere fotosensibilizzante e di essere molto più delicato sulla pelle. Già dopo pochi utilizzi, la pelle appare più densa, i pori meno evidenti e le rughette iniziano a diminuire. Inoltre, aiuta a schiarire i segni lasciati dal sole o dai brufoli.

Lato packaging mi piace parecchio (come tutti i prodotti di questo brand). In questo caso ha una bellissima boccettina viola che che protegge il prodotto dai raggi solari, eliminando la necessità di conservarlo in un armadietto.

Lo uso tutte le sere nella mia night routine e posso confermare che, nonostante la mia pelle sia estremamente sensibile, non ho riscontrato alcuna irritazione, sfogo o arrossamento.

Il rapporto qualità/prezzo è assolutamente ottimo, rendendo questo siero molto appetibile e, come tutti i prodotti Purito che ho provato finora, non mi ha deluso. Approvato e consigliato per chi cerca un trattamento efficace e delicato per la pelle sensibile!"

Der Geruch des Produktes ist dafür etwas unangenehm. Es ist nicht parfümiert, was ich eigentlich gut finde, der Geruch des Serums ist aber irgendwie scharf. Es stinkt nicht bestialisch, es ist nur kurz etwas unangenehm.
Die Textur des Serums dagegen finde ich toll, es ist eher dickflüssig und somit lässt es sich sehr gut auftragen, wie eine leichte Creme. Ich hätte es allerdings besser gefunden, wenn das Serum in einem Spender geliefert würde. Ich denke mal, wenn die Flasche halb leer geworden ist, werde ich Schwierigkeiten haben, mit der Pipette Creme zu entnehmen. Vielleicht werde ich es dann einfach umfüllen in einen leeren Pumpspender.
Die Wirkung des Serums gefällt mir gut, es regt die Durchblutung an und die Haut erneuert sich schneller. Jedoch finde ich auch, dass man nach dem Serum noch eine Feuchtigkeitscreme auftragen sollte, damit die Haut nicht austrocknet. Meine Haut ist etwas trocken, da greife ich gerne zu einer fetthaltigen Nachtcreme, um den leicht austrocknenden Effekt des Serums auszugleichen."

Su fórmula es ligera y de rápida absorción. Además es hipoalergénica, por lo que es altamente indicada para pieles sensibles. Suelo aplicar el serum antes de la crema, extiendo suavemente una pequeña cantidad por todo el rostro y el cuello a modo de golpecitos suaves para una absorción óptima. Dentro de la misma gama, encontramos la Crema Timeless Bloom Retinol Spot, y sinceramente recomiendo usar ambos productos en conjunto para obtener la mejor experiencia para la piel.

Tras su uso la piel queda luminosa, hidratada y más firme. Suaviza las arrugas y da sensación de un rostro rejuvenecido, con mucha luz. Siento que mi piel luce más joven y flexible cuando uso este producto.

Es todo un acierto, y me encanta una marca tan comprometida: todos sus productos son apto para veganos, libre de crueldad, sin fragancia sintética, consciente de la Tierra, Ingredientes suaves y naturales."

Zweimal entnehmen ist allerdings auch keine Katastrophe.

Das Serum lässt sich gut und sparsam verwenden. Es zieht schnell ein. Allein der Geruch stört mich. Auch wenn der Geruch nur sehr kurz vorherrscht und ich nicht empfindlich bin, mag ich diesen Geruch gar nicht. Es riecht kurz stark nach Chemie, ein wenig nach Klebstoff.

Das Serum pflegt meine Haut. Allerdings hatte ich mit mehr Durchfeuchtung gerechnet. Ohne eine reichhaltige Nachtcreme wäre meine Haut etwas trockener. 3 Sterne!"

PURITO è un brand di cosmetici con ingredienti vegani, gentili sulla pelle. Ogni prodotto di questa marca hanno un potere calmante e idratante sulla pelle. Gli ingredienti migliorano l'elasticità.

Non crea irritazione, bruciori o bollicine. Si assorbe in fretta e lascia la pelle asciutta e non appiccicosa. Dopo pochi utilizzi la pelle risulta più idrata, rimpolpata e ringiovanita.

Abbinato alla crema della stessa linea da sicuramente più benefici."

Sus dos activos más destacados son el bakuchiol, también conocido como retinol vegetal y el extracto de hojas de hortensia de Jeju que trabajan en conjunto para revertir el paso del tiempo.

Se trata de un sérum bastante ligero que una vez aplicado sobre la piel, no genera esa sensación pegajosa característica de este tipo de productos. Cabe destacar que deja la piel muy confortable, libre de rojeces e irritaciones. La ventaja del bakuchiol es que a diferencia del retinol, no se degrada con la luz solar por lo que puede utilizarse de día sin problema.

Aunque es algo suave para mi piel, debo decir que me está fascinando cada día más; lo combino con la Spot Cream de la misma línea Timeless Bloom de PURITO y la verdad es que más encantada no puedo estar, pues los efectos no se hacen esperar demasiado y se nota muchísimo en las líneas y pequeñas arrugas.

Este serum, como todas las líneas de la marca, tiene un packaging increíble, con una estética depurada y elegante, el frasco es precioso, en color rosa intenso, incluso el extremo del gotero es del mismo color. La cantidad de producto incluido es de 30 ml.

El sérum está formulado con bakuchiol, que es la alternativa natural del retinol, ya que cuenta con muchas de las propiedades estrella del retinol, como la atenuación de arrugas y líneas de expresión y la mejora de la elasticidad y la firmeza de la piel, y tiene la ventaja de que se puede aplicar en la rutina facial de la mañana, en cambio el retinol es recomendable aplicarlo tan solo por la noche, ya que es fotosensible y eso expone la piel a una mayor sensibilidad a la luz solar.

En cuanto a la textura del sérum es semi-líquida, de color blanco y tiene una agradable y ligera fragancia cítrica, muy fresca y apetecible. Se extiende y absorbe con facilidad, y deja la piel suave, flexible y con buen aspecto, y sobre todo, me ha gustado que esté formulado pensando en las pieles sensibles, puesto que últimamente tengo la piel más delicada y con tendencia a la irritación y busco este tipo de productos de formulación suave y respetuosa.

Presumo comunque che, in caso aveste una pelle normale o secca, questa limitazione non ci dovrebbe essere. Si picchietta sul viso e lascia la pelle come di pesca e rigenerata; un pochino pochino appiccicosa ma basta aspettare qualche secondo in più che si asciughi.

Già dopo pochi utilizzi la pelle appare più densa, i pori meno evidenti, e dopo un pò migliorano anche le rughette e schiarisce i segnetti del sole o quelli lasciati dai brufoli (molto più in fretta di quello che farebbero normalmente).

Noch besser, noch effektiver, noch jünger, noch glatter….
Ja, die Versprechen sind unendlich.
Durch einen Produkttest(andere Marke) kam ich dann doch zum Bakuchiol und bin absolut begeistert.
Auf die Versprechen jeder Marke achte ich nicht.
Ich achte auf die Inhaltsstoffe und ob das Produkt meiner trockenen Haut gut tut.
Wenn meine trockene Haut gut mit Feuchtigkeit versorgt ist, habe ich weniger Falten und sehe frisch aus.
Außerdem achte ich drauf, das Alkohol sehr weit hinten in der Inci Liste steht oder am besten gar nicht vorhanden ist.
Das ist mein Haupt Augenmerk auf ein neues Pflege Produkt.

Nun aber zum Produkt von Purito:
Ich habe schon einige Produkte der Marke Purito ausprobiert und war stets sehr zufrieden.
Beim erste auftragen hat das Serum merkwürdig gerochen.
Ähnlich wie Alkohol und mein erste Befürchtung war, dass ich in den Inhaltsstoffen den Alkohol vielleicht übersehen habe.
Als ich dann noch mal in die Inhaltsstoffe reingeschaut hatte, ist mir aufgefallen, das Butylenglykol an zweiter Stelle steht. Das ist ein zweiwertiger Alkohol und ich war gespannt, wie meine Haut darauf reagiert.
Überraschenderweise vertrage ich das Serum sehr gut.
Normalerweise spannt meine Haut extrem, wenn z.b Alkohol denat. so weit vorne in der Inci Liste steht.
Doch das ist hier nicht der Fall.
Meine Haut fühlte sich sofort fantastisch an.
Nicht trocken und gut mit Feuchtigkeit versorgt.
Das habe ich selten bei einem Serum.
Ich bin gleich nach der ersten Anwendung mehr als zufrieden.
Meine Haut fühlt sich sofort so gut an, das ich nicht mal ein Nachfolge Produkt verwenden müsste.
Doch auch mit all meinen Cremes verträgt sich das Serum sehr gut.
Der anfängliche Geruch war nur bei der ersten Nutzung und danach nicht mehr da.

Fazit:
Top 👍🏻
Ich bin absolut begeistert, empfehle das Serum gerne weiter und werde es wieder bestellen."

It is scent free and feels great on the skin. I experience no irritation, greasiness or dryness.

Hydrangea is an excellent ingredient that hydrates the skin extremely well. I did read that Korean research on hydrangea extract shows that it is very effective at preventing skin photoaging. Pretty neat.

It uses Bakuchiol as opposed to Retinol. A better alternative for those wanting Retinol results but that have dry or sensitive skin. Retinol can be harsh and cause irritation or breakouts.
I still use Retinol but use this every couple of days when I need a Retinol break. This seems to help with the breakouts too since it is a natural antibacterial.
Overall I think this is an impressive, effective serum for a good value."

Caratteristiche e formulazione del prodotto
💖Progettato per tutti i tipi di pelle, anche quella sensibile
💖10.000 ppm di Bakuchiol (1%) per aiutare ad affinare i pori, migliorare la consistenza e testato clinicamente per appianare le linee sottili iniziali e la consistenza irregolare
💖Peptide (Peptide Acetyl Hexapeptide 8) aiuta a migliorare l'elasticità della pelle
💖Betaina riciclata che aiuta a idratare la pelle e agisce come una pellicola protettiva
💖Allantoina per aiutare a calmare la pelle sensibile
💖Una bellissima sinergia di erbe con lavanda, rosmarino, origano e timo per aumentare l'elasticità della pelle.

Il marchio afferma che è per l'uso quotidiano, nella routine mattina e sera e posso confermarlo.

La mia esperienza
Ho già utilizzato siero al Bakuchiol in passato, perciò posso fare alcuni paragoni. Sicuramente la delicatezza è un punto che si riscontra in tutti i sieri di questo tipo, ma il siero Purito è più efficace.
L'ho applicato nel terzo giorno dopo aver fatto una sessione di Microneedling e questo non ho avito pizzicori o irritazioni.
Ha una consistenza lattiginosa che lo rende molto piacevole da usare.
Ha un profumo leggero, ma sembra che provenga da ingredienti naturali e non da profumo sintetico.
Per quanto riguarda gli effetti antietà a breve termine non è facile capirne l'efficacia, quindi darò sicuramente la mia opinione a lungo termine.
Se sei una ragazza degli anni '90 come me, prendersi cura attiva con ingredienti antietà è qualcosa che dovremmo già iniziare.

E' un siero dall'aspetto lattiginoso, leggermente denso, che si assorbe però facilmente ma NON totalmente.

Lascia infatti la pelle quasi umida, leggermente lucida ma NON unta (si tratta comunque di un prodotto a prevalente base acquosa).

La texture della cute, soprattutto nelle parti più sottili e secche appare IMMEDIATAMENTE più compatta, un effetto che è paragonabile a quello delle creme a base di siliconi anche se, nella formulazione, non ve n'è traccia.
C'è però il tetratilexanato, che è un emolliente di sintesi e che, sia chiaro, NON è assolutamente tossico, ma nemmeno però terapeutico.

Mi spiego meglio: non è una molecola potenzialmente nociva, ma non apporta neppure alcun vantaggio vero alla pelle.
E' una sorta di solvente che facilita l'emulsione dei grassi (apolari) e dei polari (come le molecole acquose).
Di fatto è come se ""sciogliesse"" leggermente la parte grassa/apolare/cheratinica della cute donando immediatamente questo aspetto più liscio e facilitando contestualmente la penetrazione di tutti gli estratti vegetali a seguire che sono polari (acquosi).

E sia chiaro, di estratti vegetali ce n'è a iosa (lavanda, rosarino, timo..) ma, mi chiedo, serviranno davvero?
Mah..

Io sto provando questo siero da un po' di giorni e, ribadisco, l'effetto COSMETICO, IMMEDIATO, mi piace molto.

Ma da qui a credere che abbia un effetto anti-age ce ne passa..

Io, personalmente, credo più nel retinolo e nei filtri solari e qui, purtroppo, non ve n'è traccia."

My only negative is it is very heavily scented which I’m not a huge fan off when it comes to face products. It’s not too overpowering but is floral enough that I can smell it for a good hour or so after use.

La concentración del bakuchiol es del 1% (10.000 ppm), lo cual está bien; la concentración efectiva está entre un 0,5 y un 2%. También destaco entre los primeros ingredientes de la composición la glicerina y la betaína, que mantienen la piel hidratada, y el acetyl hexapeptide-8, que puede disminuir la profundidad de las arrugas.

El listado completo de ingredientes es el siguiente: Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Betaine, Bakuchiol (10,000 ppm), Hydrangea Macrophylla Leaf Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Origanum Vulgare Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Extract, Allantoin, Adenosine, Cetearyl Olivate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Palmitate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Sorbitan Palmitate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA, Sorbitan Oleate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Arginine, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, 1,2-Hexanediol.

Viene en un bote pequeño, de color rosa, con una pipeta para dispensar el producto. Tiene una textura cremosa pero muy fluida, un color blanco, y un aroma tenue que encuentro poco intrusivo y muy agradable. Deja la piel un poco pegajosa al tacto, y con una luminosidad mate. No puedo hablar de su eficacia, ya que acabo de empezar a utilizarlo.

Como contra, el precio de 25€ en este momento me parece elevado, ya que el bote solo trae 30 ml. Tampoco me gusta las gráficas que tiende a utilizar la marca, ya que resultan engañosas. En este anuncio, la elasticidad pasa de 0,57 a 0,60 tras cuatro semanas (no sé exactamente en qué unidades o cómo se mide), pero estos datos aparecen escritos en letra pequeña, mientras que las barras de la gráfica aumentan más de cuatro veces. Por estas razones, he descontado una estrella.

My skin seems to tolerate it well as I haven't noticed irritations but I will always suggest to do a patch test first.

The serum absorbs quite fast and doesn't leave a residue. This means that it is very easy to apply on top a hydrating cream and a SPF factor."

I have been a fan of every product I have tried from Purito and this Timeless Bloom Retinol Spot Cream is another excellent example of the high quality products this company is known for

This spot cream is really convenient for hitting specific areas of the face or hands. It is fragrance free with a medium/heavy weight texture. It absorbs well and I personally experienced no tackiness, redness or irritations from using it. I have dry sensitive skin and this cream felt soothing on my face leaving it soft and smooth in the areas I used it

Consistency with any skin care product is the key to achieving results so don't look for miracles overnight with this or any other retinol product, but if you are willing to do the work you will see improvements

The product comes with a full ingredients list and an expiration date. It contains lots of good stuff like Hydrangea and 1,000 ppms of Retinol. The packaging is very attractive and aesthetically pleasing to look at

I have used Retinol's on and off for many years but I don't use them daily. However, when I use them I always use them at night because the sun and Retinol are not a good mix. I spend very little time in the sun but if you do go in the sun always use sunscreen to protect your skin as Retinol increases your skins sensitivity to it. If you are new to Retinol proceed with only once or twice a week for awhile until you build up a tolerance to it

I definitely recommend this product for any skin type as it's gentle and effective

ALWAYS do a patch test 24 hours before using any new skin care products"

Results will be seen closer to the 30-day mark since this is a much lower and safer concentration of retinol.

I find using at the two-week mark, my smile lines have tightened in comparison to where they were before so I see a difference but it may not be a linear comparison for others as retinoids take time and consistency to work. I did notice that area of my skin looked more moisturised and plumper so even if it's not as effective on you, you'll get the plumping effect from the moisturising ingredients.

If you're looking to get into K-beauty retinoids and want something good for beginners, this is gentle enough to not fry your face right off. Just make sure to wear sun protection with it on and do NOT mix it with AHA/BHA or vitamin C. :)"

Klar, Wunder darf man nicht erwarten. Es ist nicht so, dass man sich ein Mal Retinol ins Gesicht schmiert und am nächsten Morgen mit perfekter, glatter Haut aufwacht. Aber ich habe tatsächlich das Gefühl, dass meine Haut sich nach regelmäßiger Anwendung besser und gleichmäßiger anfühlt.

Der Preis der Creme ist natürlich relativ happig, zum Zeitpunkt der Rezension liegt der bei stolzen 23€ für 30ml Produkt. Zum Glück ist die Creme aber auch sehr ergiebig. Ein winziges bisschen Produkt reicht tatsächlich für eine erstaunlich große Fläche. Deswegen gibts dafür keinen Abzug. :)

Ich würde aber jedem empfehlen, vor der ersten Verwendung erstmal zu testen, ob die Haut die Creme überhaupt verträgt. Meine kriegt das gut hin, aber Retinol ist ja doch nicht ganz ohne. Better safe than sorry!"

Per questa molecola, la quantità non è, in sé, un bene: alte concentrazioni non implicano necessariamente vantaggi, per la possibilità di sensibilizzare eccessivamente la pelle o – al contrario – di creare una sorta di “assuefazione”, per cui il prodotto alla lunga non fa più effetto.
Ecco perché concentrazione e frequenza con cui applicare il retinolo vanno affrontate con prudenza e dipendono sia dal prodotto che si sta utilizzando, sia da quanto la pelle sia abituata a questo ingrediente.
Se si tratta della prima volta, meglio introdurre questi prodotti nella propria routine cosmetica non più di due/tre volte a settimana.

Per quanto mi riguarda, ho una pelle sensibile che tende ad arrossarsi e disidratarsi se trattata con prodotti aggressivi; in più siamo in estate e il retinolo ha un effetto esfoliante che favorisce il turnover cutaneo. Pertanto ho iniziato ad usarla a fine luglio, naturalmente la sera (di giorno, solo creme protezione 50), con la cadenza temporale che ho appena specificato.
La crema ha una consistenza piacevolissima e si stende molto bene, non ne serve molta.

In combinazione, ho usato il siero consigliato dallo stesso produttore (Timeless Bloom Bakuchiol Serum).

Ora, passato un mese, posso testimoniare che non mi ha creato la minima irritazione, la mia pelle è più liscia ed elastica, e le rughette naso labiali (dove ho applicato il prodotto) sono decisamente attenuate.

Nel mio caso, questa crema ha pertanto sortito effetti eccellenti."

Para esta reseña tomo en consideración el precio y mi experiencia con artículos similares. He tenido el placer de conocer varios productos de esta marca PURITO SEOUL y realmente estoy muy satisfecha con todo lo que he probado hasta el momento, es calidad de estética coreana y lo que puedo destacar principalmente es que, para mi piel sensible, no todos los productos son buenos y estos se adaptan de forma perfecta a mi tipo de piel, especialmente, este retinol es un tesoro para mí. Os cuento más.

👍Lo más:

• Cero irritación y proporciona gran elasticidad y aspecto sano a la piel en semanas.

👎Lo menos:

• Sin pegas.

🙋Resumen:

Desde que comencé a usar esta crema hace más de un mes he ido notando un cambio significativo en mi piel. Lo que me llamó la atención inicialmente fue su textura cremosa, que se siente suave al aplicarla, sin dejar una sensación pesada. Como alguien que tiene la piel sensible, estaba preocupada por cómo reaccionaría al retinol, pero me sorprendió gratamente lo bien que mi piel la ha tolerado. Al estar formulada con retinol al 0,1%, es lo suficientemente potente como para hacer una diferencia visible sin causar irritación.

Uno de los aspectos que más valoro de esta crema es la inclusión de la hortensia coreana. He leído sobre sus beneficios en la cosmética, y parece que realmente potencia los efectos del retinol. Después de unas semanas de uso constante, comencé a notar que las líneas finas alrededor de mis ojos y boca se veían menos pronunciadas. Además, mi piel se siente más firme y elástica, lo que me ha dado una mayor confianza y satisfacción con mi rutina. Es una sensación reconfortante saber que estoy utilizando un producto que trabaja sinérgicamente con mi piel para mejorar su apariencia.

Otro punto a favor es que esta crema está dermatológicamente probada y es hipoalergénica. Mi piel, que a veces reacciona negativamente a ciertos productos, ha aceptado perfectamente esta crema sin signos de enrojecimiento o brotes. La versatilidad del producto como crema multiuso también me encanta, ya que no solo combate las arrugas, sino que también mejora la apariencia de los poros e hidrata profundamente. En general, estoy muy satisfecha con los resultados y la recomiendo completamente.

Voici mon expérience après plusieurs semaines d'utilisation.

Ce que j'apprécie le plus, c'est la texture légère de la crème qui pénètre rapidement sans laisser de résidu gras. Ma peau sensible tolère très bien ce produit, ce qui est un énorme point positif. Depuis que je l'utilise, ma peau est incroyablement bien hydratée et plus douce au toucher. Mes pores sont également moins visibles et mon teint paraît plus uniforme.

Il est important de noter que ce produit demande du temps pour montrer des résultats visibles en termes d'effets anti-âge. Bien que je n'aie pas encore de rides à traiter, je n'ai pas encore pu observer de changements majeurs en matière d'élasticité de la peau. C'est un produit qui fonctionne sur le long terme, donc il ne faut pas s'attendre à des résultats immédiats.

En résumé, je suis très satisfaite de cette crème et je vais continuer à l'utiliser. Si vous cherchez une crème qui hydrate en profondeur et améliore progressivement l'apparence de votre peau, je vous recommande vivement d'essayer celle-ci, à condition d'être patiente pour voir les résultats anti-âge"

Ya he probado varios productos de cosmética coreana y, en mi opinión, tienen la fama bien merecida.

El producto llega en una cajita con unos mínimos consejos de uso en inglés, algo en coreano y una larguísima lista de ingredientes. Se echa de menos que, al tratarse de un producto con retinol, indiquen claramente el porcentaje de este.
La caja llega precintada, algo importante en los productos cosméticos, dentro encontramos el tubo de 30 ml.

La formulación de este producto está pensada para iniciarse en el retinol, pues, aunque como he comentado no nos indica el porcentaje de retinol, si profundizamos en la lista de ingredientes, encontramos que indica que contiene 1000 ppm, lo que equivale a un 0.1%, pero como comento, no estaría de más que lo informase de forma más clara.
El resto de los ingredientes más destacables de la fórmula son: extracto de Hydrangea (una flor coreana con propiedades antiarrugas), bakuchiol y ácido hialurónico.

Las escuetas instrucciones y consejos de uso, aunque solo están en inglés, son las típicas de la inicialización en el retinol: utilizar en la rutina de noche, realizar primero un test de tolerancia y, sobre todo, lo más importante, utilizar protector solar.

La experiencia de uso ha sido buena, a falta de comprobar resultados a largo plazo. La crema tiene una textura densa, apenas presenta olor y se extiende muy bien, cunde bastante con una pequeña dosis es suficiente. Además, se trata de una crema para zonas localizadas, no para todo el rostro. La sensación que deja en el momento de la aplicación es muy agradable, de suavidad e hidratación.

Sin duda la cosmética coreana nuevamente me ha conquistado, me parece un buen producto.

Principales aspectos que destacar:
✅ Buena presentación, producto sellado.
✅ Buena formulación.
✅ Cunde mucho.
✅ Sensación de hidratación muy agradable
⚠ Instrucciones escasas y solo en inglés."

This is a retinol cream, I got this to use as an eye and neck wrinkle cream. it's quite gentle for a retinol but you should probably still introduce it carefully as retinol can be harsh on the skin depending on how sensitive it is. I also like that they included soothing and moisturising ingredients. This feels slightly thicker than most eye area creams I've tried and I like this because it helps the area to feel moisturised for longer. This is meant to be good for wrinkles due to the retinol and bakuchiol which are popular skincare ingredients, but it also contains hydrangea extract which I didn't know but apparently it's good for wrinkles too. Overall I really like this cream, I do think it is slightly overpriced being a retinol cream but it is a korean skincare product which tend to cost more on amazon due to the cost of importing and it will last a long time if used on the eye area as you only need a small amount."

Ich kenne mich mit Inhaltsstoffen nicht gut aus, daher ein Foto von der Verpackung auf dem diese vermerkt sind.

Cremes mit Retinol sollte man nur am Abend verwenden und am nächsten Tag auf jeden Fall Sonnencreme auftragen, was man eigentlich immer machen sollte.

Ich verwende die Creme 3 bis 4 mal die Woche um die Augen und oberhalb meiner Lippe sowie über der Nasenwurzel auf der Stirn.

Sie ist geruchlos und lässt sich gut verteilen und zieht schnell ein.

Ergiebig und daher ist das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis für mich ok.

Wirkung: keine Wunder, aber ich habe schon das Gefühl, dass sich die Faltentiefe ein bisschen verringert hat.

Ich vertrage sie auf jeden Fall gut und bin zufrieden."

Como todos los productos de la marca tiene un packaging increíble, con una estética depurada y elegante, la crema se presenta en tubo flexible y contiene tan sólo 30 gr de producto, por lo que es mejor utilizarla en zonas específicas como crema de tratamiento, ya que su contenido en retinol es idóneo para esas zonas donde se forman arrugas y líneas de expresión con mayor facilidad, como en el contorno de labios.

En cuanto a la textura es cremosa, de color ligeramente amarillento y se extiende y absorbe con facilidad, dejando la piel suave, flexible y con muy buen aspecto.

En cuanto a su aplicación, al contener retinol hay que limitar su uso a la rutina de noche, ya que el retinol es fotosensible, para usar durante el día recomiendo el sérum Purito a base de bakuchiol, que es la alternativa vegetal del retinol, no es fotosensible y tiene efectos positivos muy similares sobre la piel.

En definitiva, me parece una excelente crema para tratar zonas difíciles, que ofrece muy buenos resultados gracias a su contenido en retinol."

Esta Crema Timeless Bloom Retinol Spot de Purito Seoul es un excelente producto. Entre sus ingredientes encontramos Hortensia de Jeju para ayudar a retrasar y reducir la aparición de arrugas, Bakuchiol para mejorar la textura de la piel y Retinol para mejorar su elasticidad.

Siguiendo las instrucciones de la marca, durante las primeras dos semanas, usé el producto en días alternos y luego una vez al día, y solamente en la rutina nocturna ya que al contener un 0.1% de Retinol puro la piel puede descamarse, lo que la hace más sensible al sol. Después del uso nocturno, apliqué protector solar durante el día para proteger mi piel. Dentro de la misma gama, encontramos el Serum Timeless Bloom Bakuchiol, y sinceramente recomiendo usar ambos productos en conjunto para obtener la mejor experiencia para la piel.

Tras su uso la piel queda uniforme, con las manchas atenuadas, luminosa, hidratada y más firme. Suaviza considerablemente las arrugas y las líneas de expresión, da sensación de un rostro rejuvenecido, con mucha luz. Siento que mi piel luce más joven y flexible cuando uso este producto.

Si tratta di prodotto di una delle migliori marche di cosmetici sul mercato, Purito. In questo caso si tratta di una crema «spot», il che significa che deve essere applicata su aree specifiche del viso dove vogliamo che agisca. Questo giustifica anche il formato relativamente esiguo (30 ml).
La uso principalmente sui lati degli occhi per avere un effetto sulle rughe di espressione (zampe di gallina), anche nella zona delle occhiaie o per le rughe naso-labiale.
Seguo le istruzioni, che indicano che dovrebbe essere applicato a giorni alterni, applicandone una piccola quantità senza spargerla sulla zona, ma piuttosto applicandola con piccoli tocchi. È meglio usarlo di notte. In ogni caso va utilizzata la protezione solare alta anche nei giorni seguenti (meglio sempre).

Utilizza retinolo, ma a una concentrazione dello 0,1%, il che è molto adatto se si iniziano a utilizzare prodotti con questo ingrediente per evitare sensibilizzazione. È molto utile per ridurre rughe e linee sottili, oltre a migliorare la consistenza, la compattezza e l'elasticità della pelle, grazie all estratto di fiori di ortensia. Ovviamente questi effetti sono evidenti dopo alcune settimane di utilizzo.

Personalmente utilizzo altre creme e sieri di questo marchio, e sempre con ottimi risultati, quindi continuo a usarlo e a raccomandarlo.

Anyway, I find the package design of this item to be very appealing! As per usual from PURITO, of which I am a long-term fan, the product itself also appears to be of high quality; it's scentless, absorbs extremely well, and it's not greasy at all. The area around my eyes feels a lot softer and more hydrated. The tube has a handy, thin nozzle, which makes it easy to dab in the areas you need, and a little product goes a long way.

Ho scelto di testare questo prodotto perché incuriosita dall'articolo.
Si tratta della crema al retinolo di Purito.
Arriva nella sua scatolina di cartone.
All'interno troviamo un flaconcino in plastica sigillato con 30 ml di prodotto.

Di seguito le principali caratteristiche:
🔆 crema al retinolo
🔆 30 ml
🔆 per pelli sensibili
🔆 anti invecchiamento
🔆 coreana

Ho già provato diversi prodotti della marca Purito e devo dire che sono ottimi.
Anche questa crema al retinolo mi sta piacendo parecchio.
È inodore, si assorbe velocemente e non unge la pelle.
Ne basta una piccolissima quantità per idratare e levigare la pelle del viso.
Inoltre migliora l'elasticità della pelle.
Ottima anche come base per il trucco.

Il prezzo a mio avviso è corretto in rapporto alla qualità.
Mi sento quindi di consigliare questo prodotto.

Voto 9

Spero che la mia recensione possa esservi d'aiuto 🤗"

No obstante, esta marca, antes desconocida para mí, resulta ser una marca un tanto famosa en Corea del Sur (al igual que Shiseido en Japón). El aroma es agradable y la textura es de muy fácil absorción por la piel. No he visto resultados inmediatos, pero entiendo que, gracias al retinol, puedes hacer que la piel se vuelva más tersa y desaparezcan un poco las arrugas.

La presentación del producto es elegante y moderna, lo que añade un valor estético a la experiencia de uso. Al aplicar la crema, se siente una ligera frescura en la piel, lo cual es muy agradable, especialmente en climas cálidos. La cantidad de producto que viene en el envase es suficiente para varias semanas de uso diario, lo cual es conveniente y justifica el precio. Además, al ser una marca reconocida en Corea del Sur, se puede confiar en que ha pasado por controles de calidad rigurosos.

No le pongo 5 estrellas debido a que el anuncio está malamente traducido, con partes en inglés y las partes en español, no se entiende muy bien lo que pone.

I use this retinol anti-aging cream as a remedy for the skin around my eyes and so far I quite like it.

The cream has a very mild, neutral scent which I appreciate as I don't tolerate well heavily-scented cosmetics. The cream is easy to apply and it has more of a thicker texture which means that one needs really a tiny amount for the skin around their eyes.

The cream absorbs really quickly, doesn't leave a sticky or oily residue, and has a matte effect to it.

My skin tolerates it well but I would suggest to do a patch test-first.

I use this cream as part of my night-care skin routine and I follow with a hydrating cream afterwards."

They suck up every last bit of gunk from the skin and leave a flat red area that will repair itself quickly. :)

I think the added Centella ingredient did a very good job in these patches because I saw a lot fewer red areas in the red pore volcanoes I stuck each patch on. They're strong and stayed on all night after tossing and turning so the adhesion is excellent. Additionally, there are two sizes in this set; 12mm for jumbo spots and 10mm for normal areas. This isn't something I usually see so I'm glad they're making spot patches for the larger areas now.

I think overall, this is well worth the money because I saw results overnight when applying to areas that needed to get the gunk sucked out of them. I like them a lot and will be reordering when I run out!"

They still soak up all that disgustingness super well, comparable to the other, super popular ones for patches. I am a bit skeptical when it comes to the brightening ingredients used. That being said, it, even just as a placebo, makes me feel like it’s offering some help. This concern does not disappear overnight so even if it does work, it will take a couple to really see an effect. I am still happy with the performance.

I am a big fan of Purito’s centella line (although the serum was definitely a pass). I have the sunscreen which became my favorite and this was yet another success. If this stays at around $10, this is absolutely worth a try."

Korean, which tend to put out excellent skincare products. These acne patches have a bit of a different look to them than the other more generic pimple patches out there. (see photo) These- you can just tell are higher quality than the typical pimple patches available. Also, these are Centella (plant) based, the other pimple patches out there don't typically list that as an ingredient. Better quality and ""different,"" also means you get a smaller number of patches per box. 51 in this case. They stick onto the skin perfectly, are almost unnoticeable ""on"", and mute pimples well when you are wearing them. You can see the sticker if you look closely so I'm not quite certain I would wear them in the daytime still. Overnight is preferable to me. They are very comfortable to wear, you hardly can feel them at all, have caused me no irritation. I use them overnight (as I said) mostly, to reduce redness and swelling in any pimples that come up. They won't get rid of the pimple, but they will improve it. Make it easier to cover up the next day, and shorten the duration of the blemish. You want to be sure to not use your fingernail to scrape up the edge of the sticker, when you are getting ready to place it, because it will curl up the edge, and then the pimple patch will be more visible on your face. This is why they split the plastic backing down the center of each pimple patch, so you can pull it off carefully that way and not curl the edges of the sticker. I think these pimple treatments are excellent, I struggled with cystic acne through my teen years, and these would have made a huge difference for me in those years, I'm mid-life and I'm still having to treat random pimples, and these patches are one of the best discoveries I've come across for that in recent years."

These do not slide off, do not become gummy when wet, blend in seamlessly with the skin, and most importantly: they *actually* heal and soothe blemishes fast. I've had some really angry zits essentially vanish overnight thanks to these things.

Visually, they have a bit of a ""blur"" effect that can help conceal blemishes, and because they are so flat and really stay put, I've even been able to put makeup over them if needed.

I really hope these don't disappear from Amazon again, because nothing else compares."

It also contains alcohol and niacinamide. I prefer my skin care products to have no alcohol and a low percentage of niacinamide, only because I have dry, aging skin which those ingredients can irritate.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that this product is not drying to my skin and actually feels very soothing. It seems that the 60% seawater, Allantoin, and sodium hyaluronate provide enough hydration and soothing to balance out the drying ingredients.

End result-my skin really seems to love this stuff. After an evening application and a good night's sleep my skin looks positively dewy and healthy in the morning.

To me the best thing about this hydro wave cream is that it can do some repair work on my skin (due to the niacinamide) while also hydrating and not irritating my skin. That has been a hard balance to find. Given that discovery I will continue to use this product nightly and if increased benefits are evident I will definitely reorder."

This is a lovely gel-cream texture, left my parched skin bouncy and calm. No scent, which is a necessity for me. Used for three weeks, with all other items in my routine kept the same. Moisture levels were improved, and it played well with the couple of active serums I can tolerate (gentle retinol, vitamin c serum). Cleared up dry patches and effectively moisturizes skin. If you're looking for moisturizers with actives, this isn't the product for you. But if you're looking for a solid, non-greasy moisturizer that balances skin and has very little chance of irritation, then I think this is a really good option."

This product is something I am repurchasing again actually, from the original Deep Sea Water Cream which has been come out with new packaging in 2024. I contacted Purito customer service directly via email to confirm that this was just a brand repackaging (new look), and not actually a reformulation of the product itself. They confirmed there is no change to the ingredients, so I repurchased it. I really loved the original moisturizer and wanted to get this one too on the amazon prime day sale.

When I first got it, I wanted to make sure I was getting the real product (sometimes products on amazon can be fake) and this is in fact, real. I noticed that the tube itself seemed a bit lighter than the original tube.
The only con with this product and the reason why I gave 3 stars is because if you notice very carefully, when you hold it up to the light, you can see that there is some empty space in the tube, so it's actually not completed filled up with the product. I was disappointed, because I've seen this happening more in everything (like even chip bags, am I paying for air or chips?! lol) and so around 1/5 of it seems to be emtpy, you can't see the product is there when holding it up to the light. Try to see with your own product if you buy as your phone camera may not be able to do it justice.

Besides that flaw (maybe it was just my batch that had a little extra air and other tubes were fine), the product itself is spectacular. For oily skin, I like that it is so light-weight and gel-like almost, but is still hydrating and doesn't leave my skin dry. This is perfect for spring/summertime, for winter may need a little more oomph.

Overall, I will keep repurchasing this as my daily moisturizer and would recommend for others as well."

Still, it agrees with my skin well, doesn't have much of a scent, and serves its purpose well. I've removed one star for the cost, as although this is a nice cream, I'm not sure it's luxury-tier, so $21 (at time of review) for 1.69 ounces is a bit steep. Personally, I'd rather have a cheaper cream and a more expensive one than one middle-of-the-road moisturizer, but this is still a fine choice if you are okay with the cost."

I recently discovered Purito from a dermatologist whom I follow online (unpaid endorsement). And typically when I discover a brand, I like to use the cleanser, toner or serum, and moisturizer combo so I can truly see if they are a fit. This serum was part of a cleanser and moisturizer combination I am testing out. Much like a lot of serums, it's light weight and appears to be ""sticky"" until it's fully dry. It layers very nicely under a moisturizer and sunscreen. Not sure I see any plumping action, but my skin looks good as we go through these brutal summer months. No amount of topical hydration makes up for drinking tons of water and I'm trying to do both. it's been a week of Purito, and so far I'm enjoying the cleansing, moisturizing benefits of my trio."

Went on smoothly, absorbed/dried quickly, face felt moisturizer, but not nearly as moisturizing as my other face lotion. I wasn't expecting much from nonsense that claimed to contain Deep Sea Water from exactly 605 meter down. I mean really, I thought, ""Serious quackery. What effect could DSW have on someone's face anyway?"" Pfft.

An hour or so later a friend came over and right away mentioned how good my face looked (only second time he has ever done so and coincidently the other time was after using Purito Toner). I asked him to expand on the compliment (strictly for sake of this review...well, and my ego) and he said it looked healthier and slightly ""glowy.""

Next day, I did a little test on my hands. I applied/patted in a narrow strip down the back of each hand. [FYI-I'm over 60, with well-abused, dry hands.] An hour later I looked at my hands, and there before my eyes were two visibly less wrinkled, ""glowy"" narrow strips running down the length of both hands.

I've done this little test for years with just about every lotion/serum/oil/etc., I've used. None showed much of anything after a full hour - maybe a little temporary hydration and plumping lasting about 10 minutes. However, the results of this little test were almost enough to make me a believer.

Still being a pure skeptic at heart, I decided to do a google scholar search re DSW and effects on skin and discovered what I thought to be utter nonsense actually has some scientific merit to it. Look it up the medical literature for yourself. Drinking pure DSW (not this serum - disclaimer for the T supporters amongst us) showed benefits as well.

I'm going to continuing to use this product to see if there are any long-term noticeable improvement(s). Will try to remember to update in 6 months with those results.

For now given what I've seen, a definite Buy"

The product feels like it's helping me keep my skin moisturized, but it doesn't feel heavy or make my skin feel like I'm wearing a mask. The serum did leave my face a tiny bit sticky, but since I'm layering on a sunscreen and possibly a moisturizer, it's not a huge issue."

The ingredients list looks clean and there is no synthetic fragrance which I always appreciate. The serum has no scent to speak of and is clear.

I can’t say I see immediate plumping results from this serum as promised but I have also not had any adverse reactions. I am going to give it more time to hopefully show long-term results.

Made in Korea. Expiration date for the bottle I received is three years out. (Also I appreciate they printed it on the bottle in addition to the box which gets immediately thrown out.)"

I love that it comes with safety seals on the top and the bottom! Also the expiration date is 4/16/2027.

I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions. Little to zero scent that I can detect.

The consistency is ALMOST gel like but too watery to be gel. But it does have some thickness to it so you’re able to apply it without it being straight watery and wasting a ton of serum.

I truthfully don’t feel like it’s very hydrating - and once dried, it actually makes my skin feel a bit on the sticky side. It does make my skin feel a *little* plumped, but definitely nowhere near as hydrating as I would assume a Hydro Wave Deep Sea Serum would be…

I will continue use for a little longer, just because I do love Purito and really want to give this serum a fair chance. If I have a change of heart and end up loving it, I will come back and update my review.."

I’ve always had good results and never any irritation or breakouts from their products, and this one is no exception. I tested it out twice a day as my primary serum in between a vitamin C essence and prior to either sunscreen in the morning or an occlusive moisturizer at night.

It looks like it has a thick, syrupy texture in the bottle, but comes out more watery. It does have a fresh, watery scent, but is barely detectable and might be okay for some people who don’t care for fragrances. I don’t mind scents, although some break me out. It spreads easily on skin with a cooling sensation, and is very lightweight but hydrating. This is a good hydrating product for people who have dry skin but don’t like the feel of heavier products, or are also prone to breaking out from heavy skincare products.

The only thing I don’t care for about it is that it doesn’t seem to fully dry down and leaves a slightly tacky texture on my face, especially when used in combination with other “sticky” products. It isn’t a problem at night, but can cause makeup to pill up over it, so it’s not a suitable moisturizer for the morning."

It comes in a clear bottle so you can see how much product is still inside, and has a convenient pump at the top to administer just the amount that you need.
The serum itself is light and goes on smoothly without being sticky or heavy. It takes a little bit of time to seep into your skin, but once it does it is not noticeable other than the fact that skin feels really hydrated. I mostly use this at night as a deep moisturizer, and do not follow up with a lotion afterwards because this does the trick. I think it's perfect for the hot summer months because while my skin still needs moisturization, I don't like using thick heavy products when it's hot out. This is cool and refreshing, and is perfect for light long lasting moisture.
I always appreciate when I find cruelty free beauty products that also care about the environment. It's great to see beauty brands doing their part to create safer products. I was also impressed by the addition of the snow mushroom capsules in the serum, as I have never had the pleasure of using that ingredient before.

It's not gel-like. More like water. Or perhaps a thin, watery, gel-like consistency is more accurate. It feels very wet once applied. After patting it onto my face, it absorbed fairly quickly. My skin felt plumper and more ""bouncy"". I know, it's an odd description but having patted my skin to apply, it makes sense.

There was no need for a moisturizer. There was no tightness. In fact, it felt like it was well hydrated. There was a nice glow left on my skin from the serum. And not due to shimmer or glitter, as this is completely clear.

Hier ist unsere ehrliche Einschätzung mit 4 Sternen.

Das PURITO Hydro Wave Deep Sea Serum kommt in einer eleganten, praktischen Flasche mit 60 ml Inhalt. Das Serum hat eine leichte, gelartige Textur, die sich wunderbar angenehm auf der Haut anfühlt. Besonders beeindruckend ist, wie gut es Feuchtigkeit spendet, ohne ein fettiges Gefühl zu hinterlassen. Es zieht schnell ein und hinterlässt die Haut weich und hydratisiert.

Der Einsatz von Meerwasser und anderen feuchtigkeitsspendenden Inhaltsstoffen sorgt dafür, dass die Haut frisch aussieht und sich frisch anfühlt. Das Serum eignet sich gut für alle Hauttypen, auch für empfindliche Haut. Es hat keinen starken Duft, was ich persönlich sehr schätze, da es weniger irritierend ist.

Ein kleiner Wermutstropfen ist der Preis, der für einige vielleicht etwas hoch erscheinen mag. Dennoch finde ich, dass die Qualität des Serums den Preis rechtfertigt, besonders wenn man auf der Suche nach einem zuverlässigen Feuchtigkeitsspender ist.

Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass das PURITO Hydro Wave Deep Sea Serum eine hervorragende Wahl für eine intensive Feuchtigkeitsversorgung ist und sich angenehm in jede Hautpflegeroutine einfügt. Es bietet ein gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis und könnte für viele ein wertvolles Produkt sein."

Para esta reseña tomo en consideración el precio y mi experiencia con artículos similares. Llevo semanas usando este producto y realmente es de estos productos que se destacan y de los cuales te enamoras para hacerlos parte de tu rutina permanentemente. Os cuento más.

👍Lo más:

• Hidrata de forma eficiente y se absorbe completamente.

👎Lo menos:

• Sin pegas.

🙋Resumen:

Recientemente, incorporé este sérum en mi rutina de cuidado de la piel, y debo decir que ha sido una adición maravillosa. Desde el primer uso, noté una sensación de frescura y ligereza en mi piel. El sérum tiene una textura acuosa que se absorbe rápidamente, sin dejar una sensación pegajosa. Esto es especialmente importante para mí, ya que prefiero productos que no sobrecarguen mi piel. El envase de 60 ml es generoso y me da la tranquilidad de que durará bastante tiempo.

Lo que realmente me ha impresionado es su capacidad de hidratación profunda. Después de unas pocas semanas de uso, mi piel se siente mucho más hidratada y elástica. He notado una mejoría significativa en la textura de mi piel; se ve más suave y luminosa. Este sérum contiene ingredientes marinos, que, según la marca, ayudan a retener la humedad y mejorar la barrera de la piel. Siento que mi piel está más protegida contra los factores ambientales dañinos, lo que es un gran beneficio, especialmente en climas extremos.

Además de sus propiedades hidratantes, me encanta que esta marca que conozco desde hace un par de meses por otros productos, es estética coreana reconocida a nivel mundial por su alta eficacia y calidad. El sérum está formulado con ingredientes naturales y libre de sustancias nocivas. Esto me da mucha confianza al usarlo, sabiendo que no estoy exponiendo mi piel a químicos agresivos. A lo largo de mi experiencia con este sérum, no he experimentado irritación ni reacciones adversas, lo cual es un gran alivio dado que tengo una piel bastante sensible. En general, estoy muy satisfecha con este producto y lo recomendaría a cualquiera que busque una solución eficaz y suave para la hidratación profunda de la piel.

Questi due prodotti funzionano davvero bene insieme, potenziando i loro effetti idratanti.

Il siero mi ha conquistata: è fresco, non appiccicoso e perfetto per l'estate, quando la mia pelle tende a lucidarsi facilmente. La sua formula leggera è un vero sollievo. Entrambi i prodotti vantano una composizione impeccabile, con ingredienti vegani, privi di sostanze dannose come parabeni e coloranti, e non testati sugli animali. Inoltre, il packaging è dotato di un bollino con QR code per verificarne l'autenticità.

Il flacone da 60 ml è decisamente generoso, offrendo una quantità di prodotto doppia rispetto a molti altri sieri. L'aggiunta del dosatore è un dettaglio che apprezzo molto per la praticità d'uso.

Il siero idrata efficacemente la pelle e si assorbe rapidamente, preparandola perfettamente all'applicazione della crema. Nonostante le promesse marketing un po' esagerate sull'acqua di mare speciale, il prodotto rimane valido e privo di ingredienti nocivi.

Ho notato un leggero profumo particolare, ma non fastidioso. In conclusione, il PURITO Hydro Wave Deep Sea Serum è un ottimo siero idratante, soprattutto per chi ha una pelle grassa o mista. La sua formula leggera, gli ingredienti di qualità e il formato generoso lo rendono un prodotto da considerare."

Este serum Hydro Wave Deep Sea de Purito Seoul es un excelente producto. Entre sus ingredientes encontramos Aguas profundas del mar de Gangwondo para equilibrar y reforzar la hidratación, Complejo Marino para nutrir la piel y Hongo de Nieve para una hidratación máxima.

Su fórmula es un suero de acabado ligero y húmedo con una sensación refrescante y de rápida absorción, nada graso. Además es hipoalergénico, calma rápidamente, por lo que es altamente indicada para pieles sensibles. Tras su uso la piel queda hidratada, fresca y suave durante bastante tiempo.

Podemos aplicarlo como paso de preparación en la rutina de cuidado de la piel antes del maquillaje para obtener una piel radiante e hidratada. Dentro de la misma gama, encontramos La crema Hydro Wave Deep Sea, y sinceramente recomiendo usar ambos productos en conjunto para obtener la mejor experiencia hidratante para la piel.

A mí personalmente me ha gustado, pero hay que destacar que se trata de un producto sin beneficios extras, simplemente se centra en hidratar y retener la humedad de la piel. Por lo que si buscas únicamente un producto humectante, es ideal para tal fin. En cambio, si quieres que trate otros temas como arrugas, firmeza, elasticidad.. te recomiendo buscar otras opciones.

Me encanta una marca tan comprometida: todos sus productos son apto para veganos, libre de crueldad, sin fragancia sintética, consciente de la Tierra, Ingredientes suaves y naturales."

Its definitely soothing and hydrating. If I put it on dry skin I definitely find it sticky. If I put it on immediately after washing my face, Its perfect. I dont get any stickiness if i do it that way. Just wetting your skin first and patting it with a towel before applying this moisturizer would also be a solution, as well. I have very sensitive and reactive skin and this hasnt given me any issues. I'll update once I've used it for a longer period of time.

Edit Update 11/30/24
I've been enjoying this moisturizer for the last month but my bottle is almost empty so I went ahead and purchased the new version with Bamboo extract and the new packaging. The formulation is slightly different, though the only ingredient addition is bamboo extract (as far as I know). My skin looks 100 percent matte with this version, whereas the previous one left behind a healthy glow. I'm not sure which effect I prefer. Matte finish certainly looks more natural. I also have noticed that the previous version had a very refreshing, cooling effect upon application and the experience seems to be missing from the new formulation, which is disappointing. After applying, I also noticed some flakiness on my forehead. I dont know if it's because I started using the mighty bamboo face wash a few days ago and its dehydrating, or if it's the recent turn to cold weather. I'll update again now that I'm using the new formulations, as it has only been a couple of days. So far, I can still safely say I haven't had any inflammation, irritation, redness, itchines, reactions, or acne while using these products. That alone is five stars for me.
LAST UPDATE: PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULATION PLEEEEEASE. These products started sensitizing my skin. I do have a grass allergy so the bamboo addition may have ruined it for me. Got temporary red, itchy, bumpy patches on my face multiple times. The reactions ceased as soon as I stopped using the new versions of these products. So disappointed."

First time I used it, I hated how sticky it was and once it sunk in, it wasn't nearly moisturizing enough for my dry skin.

BUT after playing around with it, this stuff is amazing. I apply a lot, about a quarter size, and spread on my face and neck. Then I give it a minute or two to sink in. I've never had such soft skin with no greasiness. The trick is to put on a thick layer and let it sink in.

It's helped with my redness too, though not overnight.

I agree with some of the other reviewers, this actually may not be the best option for an impaired skin barrier, despite the way its marketed. I had some sensitivity after experimenting with exfoliating acids and this definitely stung. No idea what ingredient would cause that though.

Oddly, I would still agree with the claim that this is skin barrier strengthening. I have definitely noticed my skin is much healthier in almost every way.

Rating 4 stars because it definitely takes some getting used to and this may not be the best option for an impaired skin barrier even though that seems to be who it is marketed for."

Given my usual inclination towards fuller coverage and matte finishes, I wasn't sure I would like this in terms of performance as much as the tirtir cushion, which serves as my baseline for comfort to coverage. I think this is a great everyday in-between and have been using it as such. I have very textured, oily, acne prone skin and this is able to cover my dark discoloration spots and redness without any issue in a very thing, comfortable layer. This is definitely not as matte as the tirtir but it also has less of a thick feel to it and after a day out, I look shiny but not unbearably so. With maybe 2 powder touch ups throughout the day, I can maintain it at matte or semi-matte. Overall very impressed with this foundation because I don't normally look for calming or good for skin claims when shopping makeup. That all aside, this still works for me and is currently my daily foundation."
B0D5CW983D__11,B0D5CW983D,R1AD57QKJ5WMEH,Lover of All Things Beauty,"PURITO SEOUL Wonder Releaf Centella BB Cushion #21 Light Beige, Foundation, Korean Centella, Makeup Long Lasting, Flawless Coverage, K-Beauty, 15g, 0.52 fl.oz","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","This comes in a nice outer product box. It’s sealed. It’s made in Korea. It says it’s cruelty free, vegan, no synthetic fragrance, gentle ingredients, and earth conscious. It looked like they didn’t have an ingredient list in English, but then I saw that the inside of the box had the ingredients in English, and they’re also in English on the refill pack. There’s also an expiration date listed on the box and bottom of the compact.

The compact is nice. It isn’t too thick or bulky (which a lot of cushion compacts can be, so it’s nice when they aren’t).

I got this in the shade #23 Natural Beige. Usually with K-Beauty foundations I go for a shade 13 or 21. I was hoping #23 wouldn’t be too dark for my very fair skin. It looked like it might be given the product photos - it looked really dark, especially for K-Beauty. But, usually K-Beauty products are pretty light and I can make #23 shades work, so I was hoping that was going to be the case with this. Fortunately, it looks a lot darker in the product photos than it is in person. In the cushion, it looks pretty dark, but actually swatched and applied, it looks much lighter (see my swatch photos - taken in indirect natural light and direct natural light). So, thankfully, I was able to make this work. But, if the brand offers a shade 21 or 13, that would be much better for me.

I have dry skin. When it’s warmer, my skin is more dry to normal and in the winter my skin gets extremely dry. I prefer to use a foundation that isn’t drying but still sets on its own so I don’t need to use powder. This claimed to be a semi-matte finish, so I was hoping it would set on its own but not be too drying for my dry skin. This isn’t what I’d call a semi-matte finish. I’d call it more of a natural finish. With my dry skin I prefer not to use powder, and without powder, in order for my makeup to last as long as possible, I need it to set on its own, or at least mostly set on its own. This sets down enough where it wears well throughout the day. But, it doesn’t set down to what I’d call a semi-matte finish. It has a subtle glow to it. Not glowy where I’d call it a dewy finish, but not semi-matte either. It’s a kind of natural, subtle glow like healthy skin.

This applies nicely. The included applicator works well, but it also applies easily with my own sponge (like a beauty blender) or brush. When using a cushion foundation, it’s always important not to press too much into the cushion. You can end up with a ton of product on the sponge. I just lightly press it into the cushion (just barely pressing down) and then I take the sponge and dab it onto my skin. I don’t swipe at all. I just press it into the skin. Doing this gives me nice, smooth, even coverage. A very thin layer gives okay coverage (covers my redness and small post acne marks) and looks like skin. I was able to build it up a little in areas where I needed more coverage (like where I have sun spots).

This didn’t feel dry on the skin at all. Like I said, it has a natural finish to it. It sets down almost completely. Without powdering my face, it does transfer some if I touch my face. But it doesn’t transfer much aside from when I touch my face. If I use setting spray, it doesn’t transfer at all. The rest of my makeup applied nicely over this. This lasted all day long without leaving my skin looking or feeling dry.

Overall, I really like this. The shade wasn’t the best match, but I was able to make it work. I would definitely purchase this if they have a lighter shade. I tried to see if they offered one, but couldn’t find it. If you’re looking for a cushion foundation that gives nice, buildable coverage, goes smoothly on and looks like skin, doesn’t feel or look dry but sets on its own to a smooth, natural finish, then I’d recommend this."

I might be a little biased, though, because this is the closest skin tone match I've ever gotten with foundation, so I was so blown away by that.

In addition, though, this foundation lasted all day, and it didn't get a cracked look to it. It also didn't give me that *foundation-makeup* look that a lot of products do. It looked a lot more natural. It also came off immediately with a makeup remover!

Okay so... when it comes to skin makeup I am usually one of the lightest 3ish shades in whatever line of products. So this is a bit dark for me. That's my own fault.

As far as a foundation in general this is everything I would want. It is light enough to not feel cakey but goes on smoothly enough to cover what I need to to cover. The finish is ""dewy"" as per most K-beauty brands. It's super easy to use, and it came with an extra refill which was great.

The shade is too light for me as someone who is light-medium, so I would recommend this for people who have a light complexion. The formula is a satin finish and it has medium coverage. I thought it was a little too cakey when I used their provided sponge, so I used my foundation brush to apply the cushion cream for more natural coverage. The scent is pretty strong, so if you're sensitive to scents this might not be as good for you. Overall, I think this would be a good product if you're looking for a medium coverage, satin foundation."

Despite this shade being way too yellow for me, I'm trying to review this fairly. The lightness of the foundation seemed right, the undertone is just very yellow. The foundation itself has a strange chalk/powder like finish that accentuates texture you didn't know you had. I'm really surprised how terrible this is for texture. It really will show every nook and cranny.

I’m a fan of TirTir but sometimes it’s just TOO much coverage for me and doesn’t always looks amazing on me. This Purito Seoul is definitely more of a medium coverage, but looks WAY better on my skin than TT does. It doesn’t seep into my pores or fine lines, and blends into my skin perfectly!

For the foundation itself, I would rate 0 stars.

Pros:
- Packaging is a beautiful compact container with mirror and puff included and very high quality with a luxury feel.
- The product comes with an extra refill sponge which is great
- Easy to apply
- Fairly lightweight to apply
- A little bit of product goes a long way
- Good Coverage while it lasts
- Matches my skin tone well...I have a very fair ivory skin tone
- Seems to have some pretty good ingredients
- Only causes minor breakouts (I have sensitive, acne-prone skin)
- Good Value for the price if it worked

Cons:
-Emphasises dry patches
-Not transfer proof
-Breaks down fast (max 2 hrs)
-Emphasises enlarged pores and wrinkles since the product settles in them.
-Has a gross way of filling in wrinkles almost as if someone used a yellow-brown piece of floss and put it in the wrinkles lines. The product is not yellow on me at first but I'm assuming it oxidizes with time to become yellow as it sits in my wrinkles
-When I take it off, I have difficulty getting it out of my pores. I have to scrub my skin and wash it multiple times to get it out. I have large pores in my T-zone.
-The sponge is not a good idea hygiene-wise. Sponges can harbor and breed loads of bacteria especially when you use the same applicator (the included puff) to dab on the sponge, it adds bacteria every time. The company does not mention what if anything has been done to the sponge to prevent the growth of bacteria.
-I wish they had a description written on the refill sponge packaging since I almost tore open the sealed pouch without realizing that it was a refill.
-The included applicator puff is not the best but that is to be expected

Overall, I would love to love and recommend this product but I can't at least not for my specific skin. If someone has skin that is uncomplicated and unwrinkled with tiny pores this MIGHT be the right foundation for you but then why bother with a foundation at all if the skin is already perfect?"

I have pretty dry skin so it is hard to find a dependable foundation. But anytime I need my makeup to be perfect I always choose my purito. So I was very excited to try another bb cream from them that has a more natural to matte finish. This gives me pretty full coverage weather I use the included puff or a damp sponge. But the best part is that it looks very skin like even though it's high coverage. It lasts all day and I haven't had any problems using powder products right on top without setting first. I wouldn't say this has replaced my favorite but it's definitely a close runner up. I know it'll for sure be my go to when traveling.

It did have some water-resistance when fresh but my oily skin eventually pushed it all to the surface and it wiped off easily.

I have combination skin (oilier in the T-zone/dry on the cheeks) but this stayed in place all day and still looked fresh after hours of wear.

You literally just pat the included powder puff/sponge on the already-filled compact surface, press down, then use the puff to gently pat it on your face, and voila!…instant beauty. You actually get a lot with this too, since you get the prefilled compact, 2 application sponges, and one extra refill, so you can use it a long time without needing to reorder right away, making it a great value.

The foundation blends easily, has nice, even coverage, works on dry skin like mine, and leaves a beautifully dewy lightweight finish that feels like your own face, only better. It does a great job of covering some of my dark circles too, while looking perfectly natural.

The beige is a nice shade for summer, since it is a shade darker than what I would ordinarily wear…(perfect for that summer tan I hope I will get soon, LOL!) It wears and “breathes” well, even on some of the 95 degree days (which in this heat, I am loving how this literally is one and done—-one application and you’re done!) Plus, while wearing this, my dry skin feels very hydrated, with a nice satiny smooth finish…so yet another huge benefit!

I have been seeing these sponge/compact foundation styles more and more these days, and with coverage like this, I see why. The whole process of applying foundation has literally been simplified, because there is no foundation bottle to spill, or risk of over-dispensing foundation….since “easy does it” with this product! Just a touch is needed.

Purito has a “perfect for sensitive skin” formula that seems gentle enough for the driest of skin. As if that isn’t enough, it is also vegan-friendly, and cruelty-free too. It also doesn’t have any strong scents to it, it just feels “pure” and “clean”. I really love this foundation because of how it makes my skin look and feel.

In the compact it looked way too dark. But it actually ended up being a really great match for me. Coverage is light and somewhat buildable. Natural looking finish.
I did 2 days of wear tests with this. I have oily skin, so I always use a primer and setting powder.
Day 1 I used a mattifying primer. Applied using the applicator. Buffed with brush. Set.
Then I did a little research on how to apply. I probably used too much.
So day 2 I tried more of a pore blurring primer. Applied it more thinly this time, dispersing it around the applicator first. This helped... But, results of both days are enhanced pores, caking, settling. It really looks great for maybe 3 to 4 hours. But then it starts breaking down. It is not long lasting. Is not transfer resistant. After 7-8 hours I just want to take it off.
So, if you have oily skin this may not be for you, unless you only need to wear it for a few hours."

Its cream based which I believe is a plus since it provides fuller coverage than power or liquid. But I do recognize cream may not be ideal for all since it also has tendency to be heavy and may clog pores.
The packaging is especially nice and solid. There’s separate compartments for the mirror and cushion applicator, apart from the cream based foundation. This helps maintain the makeup, preventing it from getting smashed. Plus it keeps the pad from absorbing more makeup than necessary when not in use.
So I was completely on board with this foundation until I noticed the Aluminum Hydroxide in the ingredients. I’m personally against our familyusing any products with aluminum just out of precaution. To be clear, I know Aluminum Hydroxide has been found safe in cosmetics since it doesn’t get absorbed in the skin, but it’s still not a risk I’m willing to take.

I find it with a light application (which I prefer) it doesn't sink into my fine lines which at almost 60 almost everything tends to do. Overall, this is a lovely compact, comes with a refill! and at this price is a win win! Highly recommend!

I can wear shades 21 and 23 in Korean makeup depending on the season so as of right now, no.21 is a tad light(and grey). If you lean yellow-olive toned, avoid this cushion. The texture is also a bit thicker, which is not what many are looking for in a foundation nowadays. I can see it being medium to full coverage for most, but if you have raised blemishes, this may emphasize them a bit. Formula-wise, best suited for normal to oily. This is close to a soft matte finish.
I didn’t exactly notice any mention of spf on the product page, but it does have spf 30."

I usually apply foundations with a palette knife then press them in with the cushion, and this technique worked well to produce a natural finish. It wore well over sunscreen without pilling or flaking, and held up throughout a relatively hot day. It has a slightly sweet scent in the compact, but it was really barely there and went away after I applied it.

Shade 13 worked pretty well for me, although it does lean slightly yellow. Once blended out, it looked better on my skin. It also comes with a refill pack, which is always a good deal."

The packaging is undeniably impressive – beautifully designed and thoughtfully put together. It even included an extra refill and a face puff!

The BB cream itself performed well. The light beige shade perfectly matched my fair skin tone, and the coverage lasted throughout the day without appearing cakey or greasy. It felt lightweight and moisturizing on my mature skin (62 years old) without emphasizing imperfections.

However, there were a couple of drawbacks. First, adding depth to the coverage proved difficult. The finish leaned towards flat rather than offering buildable dimension. Second, the included puff applicator wasn't ideal. It felt flat and thin, making the application less than smooth. I much prefer using a brush for better control.

Overall, the PURITO Wonder Releaf Centella BB Cushion offers great coverage and a lightweight feel. With an improved applicator and the option for more buildable coverage, it could be a perfect BB cream."

I was very surprised, and pleased. It's definitely a step above.

Frequently, cushions can appear flat and one-dimensional. When I apply the foundation, I worry about looking mask-like. This one did nothing of the sort; the pigment had depth, and my skin looked glowing, moisturized, but not too dewy; it was semi-matte, and sophisticated. The finish was satin, as opposed to the dewier coverage that has been in style for the past few years. I was delighted.

Yes, I recommend this. I like this cushion much more than the recent cushions I've tried. It lasted all day, through the heat. It looked good at the end of a busy day. Recommended."

At the current price of $30 with an included replacement cushion, the price per is about on par with cheaper drugstore products making it a good value for a higher quality product.
The foundation itself applies smoothly for light to medium coverage. My problem is that the color shown in the description IS NOT the color they send. You have to scroll down and will see that the ivory color is MUCH lighter than what they show in the main description which is a really annoying oversight. What is shown is absolutely one of the beige colors which would have worked for me. As it is, I cannot actually wear this. The makeup did apply nicely and seemed to give good coverage but I cannot speak to how long it lasts etc.
Overall, I think this is a pretty good product but the description photos are really misleading.

I have combo skin. Some dry spots, some normal, an oily spot or two. I always start before using makeup with skincare and give it a few minutes to sink in before getting started. When I used this foundation, I discovered the shade, neutral ivory, was a bit too light for me. That happens sometimes since it's hard to choose the right color online. I'm neutral leaning warm and this was too cool for me. What I didn't really love about this foundation is that it seemed to sit on top of my skin vs. sinking in.

Maybe it's not so dry as we get older, and mine was fine until I hit my fifties. This makeup is a skinny layer of product that dries well and stays put—no fading for me—until the end of the day. I wear light-medium beige foundations or tinted moisturizers. These cushion foundations tend to be pasty on me. A darker color wasn't available to me. The puff applicator is pretty good; I prefer more of a puff, but these do not grab too much product and hold on to it as well. I have decided that I love how cushion compacts work, and they have a fantastic place for the sponge and one compartment for the mirror. You have to open a seal to get the makeup, which means the product is clean and fresh. This comes with a refill in foil and a dial in a lightweight, square, easy-to-wrap cardboard box.

If I found the proper lady, I would give this without hesitation as a gift item. It can be cleaned off easily. I recommend using the remover with your complexion in mind. It is listed as being for dry, oily, and combo complexions.

A reasonable price if this is your thing and you like to look light-complexioned and have a matte finish.

While nice formulas, most of the Korean foundations I've tried are too light for me (and probably 90% of American women). Despite the product photo of the Korean model with gorgeous, perfect porcelain skin, the shade I ordered (Natural Beige) is actually a perfect match for me!

The formula is amazing. It glides on and presses in easily while maintaining a moist and natural skin-like look. I used it without applying primer first, and it filled in my pores without looking cakey and gave a beautiful finish. I mean, it looks like actual skin but GOOD skin, not my usual 60-year-old-sun-damaged-large-pores-and-acne-scars skin.

The product itself comes in a compact with a mirror and applicator that stores inside the compact. This means it's easy to drop in your purse for touch-ups as well as for traveling. And if that's not enough incentive, it comes with an additional refill cushion.

I can't say enough about this. Sure, maybe I've only been using it for a few days, but it doesn't take long to know what you like when it comes to some kinds of makeup, and I am so pleased with this I will continue buying it when I run out. That says something because I'm rarely a repeat buyer - I'm always on the lookout for something that lives up to its promises of better-looking skin and have yet to find anything as nice as this. Hopefully the company will market additional shades because I really think they have a winner with this formula and that most people who try it will like it as much as I do."

Once applied, I couldn't even tell I was wearing foundation, which is a big deal for me because most liquid foundations make me feel like my face has been shrink-wrapped. Not this one. The applicator smooths the surface of the foundation perfectly. The compact is made with surgical precision and includes a mirror under the lid. I'm a huge packaging geek, and I'm truly impressed with this compact. There was even a refill included in the box! Truly impressed. This product makes me want to try everything else in the Purito line."

It doesn't cause me to break out. Provides a nice even skin tone. Easy to use and lovely packaging - also came with a refill in a nice small box. Has a good size mirror. Separates the cushion and the actual sponge with a lid inbetween them - keeps it more sanitary and clean. The sponge has a nice band and you can fit at least 2 fingers in - I can fit 3. I like the shape, it helps to get into all the nooks and crannies. I have uneven skin and while it does show, it doesn't make them more obvious. Definitely use a good moisturiser underneath if you have dry skin. Peach fuzz can be slightly obvious if not blended in well. The colour it came in surprisingly suited my skin colour - it looked a lot lighter in the cushion. It does oxidise ever so slightly and goes a little darker - not obvious but it happens. If you have dry skin and not well moisturised - I do find it does crease after a long time - will keep up for a whole day if your skin is moisturised. Satin kind of finish."

The below is my own real-world experience of using it.

Full disclosure, I don't usually wear lots of makeup, but have recently considered using a BB cream, due to its coverage and convenience - the Purito Seoul seemed to fit the bill.

It comes well-presented in the box, with the compact being the ideal size to pop in a handbag. I also liked the separate compartments for the sponge and the product itself - handy for keeping the sponge clean and dry between uses.

I found it very easy to apply, and also didn't feel like I needed to use a lot - the coverage was excellent, and even more impressively, was almost an exact match for my skin tone. I have previously struggled to find a foundation colour that does not look too yellow/orange on my skin, so I was very surprised to see how well this one blended. The finish made my face look like it had been airbrushed - I could hardly notice my pores at all.

To try and illustrate the colour match, I have added a photo to show one half of my forehead covered, one not.

In summary, it is a very good value item that I will continue to use."

While the formulas are nice, most of the Korean foundations I've tried are too light for me (and probably 90% of American women). Despite the product photo featuring a Korean model with gorgeous, perfect porcelain skin, the shade I ordered (Natural Beige) is actually a perfect match for me!
The formula is astounding. It glides on and presses in effortlessly, maintaining a moist and natural skin-like appearance. I used it without applying primer first, and it filled in my pores without looking cakey, providing a beautiful finish. It genuinely looks like actual skin, but good skin—not my usual 60-year-old sun-damaged, large-pores-and-acne-scars skin.
The product itself comes in a compact with a mirror and an applicator stored inside the compact. This makes it easy to pop into your handbag for touch-ups as well as for travelling. And if that's not enough incentive, it comes with an additional refill cushion.
I can't praise this enough. Sure, I've only been using it for a few days, but it doesn’t take long to know what you like when it comes to certain types of makeup. I am so pleased with this that I will continue buying it when I run out. That says something, as I'm rarely a repeat buyer—always on the lookout for something that lives up to its promises of better-looking skin. Yet, I have found nothing as delightful as this. Hopefully, the company will market additional shades because I truly think they have a winner with this formula and that most people who try it will like it as much as I do."

Not only does it provide flawless coverage and a long-lasting finish, but it also gives my skin a dewy matte look that I absolutely love. One of my favorite things about this foundation is how well it conceals my dark eye circles – with just 1-2 applications, they disappear completely. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. In fact, I have noticed that my skin looks and feels healthier since I started using it. I also appreciate the natural sunscreen included in the formula, giving me added protection from the sun's harmful rays.

This foundation hides imperfections on my face without feeling heavy or cakey. It provides coverage without weighing my skin down. Plus, the handy compact cushion makes it a breeze to touch up throughout the day.

The only downside I have found with this foundation is that the Neutral Ivory shade is not the best match for my skin tone. I wish there were more options available so I could find the perfect match for my complexion.

Overall, though, I am impressed with this product and will continue to use it in my daily routine. Thank you for taking time to read my review. I hope you 👍 find it helpful."

It was love at first sight of the ingredients. Mainly because this cleanser is indeed very gentle, it doesn't contain any harsh ingredients like sulfates, all of the surfactants in it and even the preservative used are all very mild.

There is no added fragrance either, but there is a very mild fresh scent, like aloe or something similar. The cleanser is a gel and I love how it glides across the skin making rich, dense and abundant foam. It is easy to rinse and did not leave my skin feeling dried out at all. As a matter of fact, my skin felt very clean and soft after using this cleanser, and even the redness from my rosacea calmed down.

Afterward I used toner on a cotton pad and no residual makeup or any other gunk showed up, so I'm assured that even though it's gentle, this cleanser does a great job.

Currently this cleanser is selling for $15, and I think that is an excellent price for a cleanser that works and is very clean in its formula. Going forward I will be using this as my second step cleansing after my oil cleanser, and because it's so affordable I can stock up!"

Oz.","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Not my first product from the Purito brand, so I was excited to try another product.

Met my expectations as a gentle cleanser.
I am a curious one, so I looked up the benefits of bamboo extract, and learned something new, how wonderful bamboo (bambusa vulgaris) is for the skin to help retain moisture.
I had previously researched and learned about Panthenol.

I am always on the hunt to learn new information.

As I mentioned, this is not my first product by Purito. I had the pleasure and opportunity to try a centella toner, another new ingredient I learned about.

I ALWAYS click on the seller store link, this is the hyperlink located right under the product title.
They have such depth of products in the skin care line
I would love to try the oil based cleanser. That's another thing, I never thought one would cleanse with oil, when one is trying to remove oils in the skin. But, I am learning so much.
This new generation has such an advantage with access to the internet to learn about products, and to start a better skin care routine at an earlier age.
I am playing catch-up for my older skin.

I do have sensitive skin, and try to stay away from harsh acids and cleansers.
So this totally meets my expectations.

Purito - keep up the great work."

This cleanser comes in the form of a clear gel. It has a fresh scent that reminds me of tea tree oil, but that's not an ingredient. The scent dissipates after using it.

I found it to be an effective yet gentle cleaner. With a bit of water, it created a lather that removed makeup and left my face feeling clean and moisturized.

I appreciate that it's vegan and cruelty-free.

It comes in a plastic flip top tube, and it's easy to dispense the desired amount. The tamper-proof seal was intact. The EXP is 2027/07/10.

See photos for package information including ingredients.

I find the current price of $15.00 to be reasonable.

Vielleicht noch 2- 3 Sätze zu den hervorragenden koreanischen Kosmetikprodukten ...
Der Name verrät es ja eigentlich schon: Koreanische Kosmetik stammt aus Korea, genauer gesagt Südkorea. Das Land ist nämlich schon seit einigen Jahren im asiatischen Raum bekannt für seine Schönheitsideale. Ob in der Mode- oder aber auch der Kosmetikszene: Hier werden die Trends gemacht. Damit wurde nach vielen Jahren Japan vom Thron gestoßen .
Die Koreaner verfolgen schon bei der Entwicklung ihrer Hautpflegeprodukte einen Ansatz, von dem wir bei vielen westlichen Herstellern leider nur träumen können . Alle Produkte sind cruelty-free. Du wirst keine Originalware finden, die an Tieren getestet wurde. Ein Grundsatz, der inzwischen sogar per Gesetz festgehalten wurde.
Doch auch sonst steht die koreanische Kosmetik im Einklang mit der Natur. Denn hier setzt man darauf, auf unnötige Zusätze komplett zu verzichten. Alkohol, PEG, Silikone und ähnliches wirst du hier in der Regel vergebens suchen. Stattdessen werden wertvolle Zutaten aus der Natur eingesetzt. Während sich im europäischen Raum oft auch Produkte als Naturkosmetik bezeichnen, die kaum eine Pflanze gesehen haben, ist das in Korea anders. Denn hier gibt es deutliche Richtlinien, an die sich die Hersteller halten müssen, um ein Siegel zu erhalten, dass die Produkte als „natürlich“ ausweisen. In Deutschland hingegen haben wir keine solche einheitlichen, rechtlichen Auflagen.Wenn du ein Label mit der Bezeichnung “Made in Korea” findest, weißt du sicher, dass du hier ein absolutes Qualitätsprodukt in der Hand hältst. Was nicht heißen soll, dass nicht andere Hersteller auch diese Ansätze verfolgen, sondern nur, dass sich die folgenden Punkte leicht auf alle koreanische Kosmetik übertragen lassen. Denn zum einen sind die Inhaltsstoffe, wie oben schon beschrieben, hochwertig und natürlich, zum anderen stimmt aber auch das Drumherum. So wird in Korea der Fokus auf alle Geschlechter gelegt und die Pflegeserien werden genau auf die unterschiedlichen Bedürfnisse eines jeden Hauttyps angepasst.

Von uns bekommt dieses Gel natürlich 5 Sterne ."

Quando fa freddo la mia pelle è mista e spesso i detergenti tendono a seccarla eccessivamente, mentre questo offre un equilibrio perfetto sia per la parte più secca che per quella grassa e risultando adeguatamente idratata ho notato anche una riduzione di brufoletti e imperfezioni.
Adatto ad essere usato sia mattina e sera, lo uso sia da solo che nella doppia detersione e anche in quel caso rimuove l'olio alla perfezione."

Per la pelle del mio viso mi trovo bene ad alternare l'uso di un detergente specifico per pelli grasse a quello di uno più delicato, e questo gel è adattissimo allo scopo. Avevo già provato la crema di questa linea ottima anche per le irritazioni e questo detergente non è da meno.
Arriva sigillato sia sulla scatola, sia sul detergente stesso. Non brucia gli occhi e non causa alcun tipo di problema.

Faccio notare solo che profuma molto di tea tree/melaleuca; effettivamente è tra gli ingredienti e io ne son contenta perché mi piace il suo profumo e che ci sia aggiunge proprietà antibatteriche al gel.

Gerade jetzt, im Winter, ist meine normale Haut deutlich trockener und benötigt mehr und reichhaltigere Pflege. Zum Reinigen meines Gesichtes greife ich bei den kalten Temperaturen gerne zu einer Reingungsmilch oder einem -balsam und vermeide schäumende Produkte eher, um die Haut nicht unnötig zu reizen oder auszutrocknen.

Der Bamboo-Cleanser enthält Panthenol, das die Haut pflegt und die Barriere stärkt.
Er schäumt leicht auf, riecht dezent und angenehm (etwas krautig-frisch) und reinigt die Haut, ohne sie auszutrocknen. Ich benutze das Waschgel morgens solo und abends nach der Makeup-Entfernung mit einem Reinigungsöl- oder -balsam."

Conosco bene il brand Purito e non ne rimango mai delusa.
🔝 Questo cleanser deterge in modo delicato, senza irritare la pelle, anzi, la lascia morbida e idratata.
🔝 È in forma di gel, non fa schiuma, ed è molto facile da applicare.
🔝 Si risciacqua altrettanto facilmente. Ne basta davvero poco per applicazione.
🔝 La confezione presenta un sigillo di qualità.

⚠️ Se proprio devo trovargli un difetto è la profumazione, non tra le mie preferite.

💰 Il costo di circa 16€ (al momento di questa recensione) non lo fa un prodotto economico, ma la qualità di questo detergente li vale tutti.

La consistenza è quella di un gel fresco, praticamente inodore, che va emulsionato con dell'acqua tiepida, ben massagggiato, e magari lasciato in posa un po'.
Quasi una via di mezzo tra un detergente e una maschera.
Sia chiaro, si può utilizzare anche come un sapone qualsiasi ma, considerando anche il costo, sarebbe un po' un peccato.
Io l'ho trovato particolarmente adatto soprattutto in combinazione con la spazzola in silicone vibrante, la pelle dopo era tanto pulita quanto però idratata e morbida.

Sebbene infatti abbia un'ottima azione lavante, NON secca assolutamente la pelle, la mia è particolarmente sensibile e capricciosa ma ha gradito moltisssimo questo prodotto.

E allora, se è così fantastico, perché solo quattro stelle?
Per il prezzo.
Capisco tutto, ma credo che un po' risenta semplicemente del fatto che i prodotti skin-care coreani in questo periodo son tanto di moda.
Che però il brand sappia il fatto suo lo si intuisce anche dalla presenza di un sigillo di garanzia sulla confezione esterna e sul talloncino in alluminio sul tubo della stessa crema.

Dieses durchsichtige Reinigungsgel wird in einer versiegelten Tube geliefert und riecht ein wenig nach Teebaumöl, was ich nicht als störend empfinde.
Das Gel lässt sich gut aus der Tube entnehmen, man benötigt nur sehr wenig, um es mit Wasser aufzuschäumen. Das Reinigungsgel entfernt Reste von Make-up, ohne das dabei die Haut austrocknet.
Einer der wichtigsten Inhaltsstoffe ist Centella. In der Kosmetik wird die Pflanze für Ihre Antiaging-Wirkung sowie ihre feuchtigkeitsspendenden und regenerierenden Eigenschaften geschätzt. Dank ihres hohen Gehalts an Antioxidantien kommt Centella Asiatica bei der Bekämpfung vorzeitiger Hautalterung zum Einsatz.
Ich verwende das Reinigungsgel morgens und abends und finde es sehr gut verträglich. Es spendet der Haut viel Feuchtigkeit und hinterlässt keinen Fettfilm. Man hat das Gefühl, die Haut ist wirklich sehr gut gereinigt.
Ich kann das Gel sehr empfehlen!

Oz.","Reviewed in Italy on November 20, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Ho deciso di provarlo perché io faccio la doppia detersione tutti i giorni, acqua micellare+detergente viso.
Questo è arrivato ben imballato e perfettamente integro. Il flacone è da 150ml, dura 12 mesi dall'apertura e quello che mi è arrivato ha una scadenza da qui a 3 anni. Mi ha incuriosito il fatto che è made in Corea, molto in voga ultimamente per quanto riguarda la skin-care.

La lista degli ingredienti (lascio foto) la trovo abbastanza corta e vedo tutti ingredienti naturali, idratanti, antibatterici, lenitivi e protettivi come: pantenolo, acido laurico, tea tree oil, ecc. L'app Yuka lo valuta il suo INCI come eccellente con 93 su 100. Non mi pare contenga profumi o almeno io non li ho sentiti.

Io lo usando al mattino (per rimuovere i residui della crema notte) e la sera dopo essermi struccata con l'acqua micellare e mi sto trovando molto bene, non mi irrita ne secca la pelle e mi pare che anche i rossori siano leggermente attenuati. A differenza di altri detergenti viso provati questo non mi ha dato fastidio agli occhi. L'unico appunto è che avrei preferito un tappo con l'erogatore per praticità, ma capisco che data la consistenza tipo gel/crema hanno preferito un packaging più da crema che da detergente.

Il prezzo è leggermente alto (16e al momento della recensione) ma bisogna considerare che ne serve davvero poco, a me ne basta una quantità simile ad un pisello per detergere tutto il viso. Lo consiglio particolarmente a pelli sensibili soprattutto adesso che con l'inverno e quindi il freddo la pelle del viso tende a seccarsi maggiormente.

I'm a little fussy about scented beauty products and even though I enjoy this scent, I'm a little hesitant to use it on my entire body. So for now I'm using it as a hand lotion, something I use a lot of especially this time of year. It's very moisturizing so is really meeting my current needs with lots of handwashing due to having covid currently going through my household.

To me, I can definitely smell the orchid, violet, musk, and some sandalwood; I like that it's not a strong overpowering scent, and that it's like a soft powdery scent that lasts.

The lotion has a nice moisturizing feeling to it, but doesn't feel heavy or greasy. It absorbs nicely onto my skin, and helps to make my skin feel soft and smooth. This has especially been helpful during the dry winter season that I'm living in right now; but would be great all year-round.

This is a great product, and of very nice quality; it works well, and is very helpful.

Calidad: La crema es bastante buena, pero no excepcional. Es hidratante y tiene una textura ligera lo cual agradezco siempre. Deja la piel con un tacto suave e hidratado.

Componentes: Contiene manteca de karité, la cual es calmante, hidratante, nutritiva, reparadora y protectora. Es un buen punto a su favor. Se nota una buena textura.

Fragancia: Es el único punto más positivo o negativo que se podría encontrar según el gusto. Si te gusta la fragancia es lo más positivo, sin duda, ya que huele muy bien y dura mucho.
La fragancia de “Romance de medianoche” es muy floral.
El olor permanece todo el día en la piel, lo cual es un punto muy positivo. Tiene un olor florar, a violeta, lilas y orquídea, tal vez con un punto de rosa. Es un olor muy dulce.
Posiblemente con la duración que tiene su perfume, la opción de Ocean breeze hubiese sido más adecuada para mi por un tema de gusto personal de fragancia, más cítrica.

El motivo por el que pongo un tres de cinco estrellas es porque aunque la calidad es buena, el precio es muy elevado, en mi opinión no justificado. Posiblemente podría ser un poco más económica. A los que les guste el perfume floral, adelante, estarán encantados, dura todo el día, más que la gran mayoría de cremas.

También valoro negativamente el hecho de que la información esté únicamente en inglés en el anuncio."

I like the overall brand with the simple blue and white packaging and no nonsense.

Absorbs well and leaves skin feeling smooth and soft as claimed.
All in all does everything a body butter/moisturiser should do.

My only complaint is over the price as £23 for 300ml is more than I'd normally be willing to pay and so despite the great impression of the product I'd still be unlikely to be a repeat customer at this current price.

PROS:
✅ Fácil de aplicar
✅ Rápida absorción
✅ Hidrata
✅ Aroma
✅ Envase práctico
CONTRAS:
🔴 Precio

CONCLUSIONES:
Si necesitas una crema hidratante que se absorba bien y se extienda sin dejar la sensación pegajosa es perfecta, a parte el aroma florar es una pasada pero no es muy duradero. He usado otras cremas de la misma marca y realmente son recomendables por calidad/precio.

First impressions are positive and it feels like a good quality product overall, which is perhaps reflected in the higher price. It’s designed to be deeply moisturising and the brand shows some clinical trial to demonstrate this.

This has an “Ocean Breeze” “Korea-inspired uplifting scent”, which I quite like as it’s a little fruity and sweet with a hint of sandalwood I think, and I don’t find overpowering. I think these days I actually quite like a bit of a scent to body and hair products, as long as it’s appealing, which thankfully I find this one is. The lotion is quite silky soft in texture and has a good consistency that’s neither too thick nor too thin. I don’t need too much per application and it smooths on nicely. It absorbs pretty well and doesn’t leave any stickiness afterwards, but I can feel I’ve got lotion on. It definitely leaves my skin feeling softer and smoother shortly after use, which is lovely. I’m hoping that with more regular use, that benefit will become more long term as it helps repair my rather dry and neglected skin, especially on my legs.

Also good to know is that this isn’t tested on animals and uses “gentle ingredients”. It’s also vegan, for those to whom this applies. I’d say it’s gentle, or at least that’s how it feels to me and I’m glad to say I’ve not had any irritation from using it. I’ve no downsides to the product actually. I love using it and it’s helping to moisturise my skin so I’m very happy with it!"

PURITO Luminous Moisture Shea Butter Body Lotion arrived packed nicely in a medium size bottle with a pump, which is nice and easy to distribute.

The scent is divine, very subtle but it stays with you for a long time, which is nice.

The texture is nice, not too thick and very gentle on my skin. My skin is very dry and it absorbs this lotion well. It feels very soft, with no residue after applying this product.

I like it and I can happily recommend it to anyone but it's slightly on an expensive side."

También en algunas estaciones del año como en invierno, se incrementaba la sensación, que pesar de probar con numerosas cremas hidratantes esa sensación no marchaba.
Al probar esta crema, no tenía demasiadas esperanzas por lo ya comentado.
Noté que la sensación es untuosa y agradable y su perfume intenso pero no molesta.
Es fácil de extenderla y deja una piel muy luminosa e hidratada.
El dosificador es muy cómodo de usar, un acierto del fabricante. Otros formatos son más incómodos a la hora de usarlos y guardarlos.
Destaco la sensación tan agradable y la gran hidratación que esta crema produce en mi piel que es adecuada para cuerpo y cara . Sus ingredientes y componentes son testados dermatológicamente y su ph balanceado hace que me de la confianza necesaria para poder recomendarla."

My wife found this cream easy to apply and non-greasy. She also found that a little goes a long way so this bottle should last a long while. She’s over the moon with how her skin feels after using this. Soft and moisturised, especially over her areas of eczema.

It's a pleasant combination of an intensely musky base aroma and citrus. You can also clearly smell the bergamot, so it's a nice array of both sweet and sour citrus when mixed together with all the tangerine. The fragrance is not subtle at all, so this may be highly irritating to those sensitive to scents. But as much as I adore the fragrance, it's very poor functional-wise. I run dry, so I course need lots of moisture. I literally needed several heaping pumps of this lotion to even feel remotely hydrated, and my skin just felt very tight and itchy after a while has passed and it fully absorbed into the skin. It's doubly confusing because this is supposed to have Shea butter as a featured active. In any case, I honestly would not recommend these if you need a lot more than a pretty scent to try this out."

Bottiglia realizzata in plastica, con dosatore molto ergonomico ed efficace: sarà sufficiente ruotarlo lateralmente per azionare il meccanismo che consente di far alzare il beccuccio, che poi andrà premuto verso il basso (a modi pompetta) per erogare il quantitativo desiderato.

Il prodotto si presenta in color biancastro consistente/denso, con texture morbida che permette un perfetto assorbimento sulla cute, senza lasciare tracce/viscosità post trattamento.
Al termine di un breve massaggio sulla zona d’applicazione, noterete la pelle divenire più morbida, liscia e setosa, e questo grazie anche all’azione del burro di Karitè, da sempre riconosciuto come emolliente e nutritivo sulla pelle.

Ero molto curioso di annusare la fragranza “Cotton Dreamlight”, e devo dire di essere rimasto piacevolemente colpito dalla delicatezza dello stesso, sebbene mi ricordi un po’ troppo il classico profumo di igienizzante già provato con altri prodotti (ma poi si sa, i gusti sono gusti).

Sempre graditissimo il marchio Vegan e la rassicurazione circa il fatto che trattasi di prodotto clinicamente provato e realizzato senza aggiunta di eccipienti chimici allergizzanti per la pelle.
Mi piace sempre sbirciare nell’INCI quando testo prodotti di questa categoria (se non altro per defezione professionale), e posso affermare che trattasi di una crema assolutamente naturale, che addirittura sotto questo aspetto mi ha stupito e ha superato le mie aspettative."

No tengo claro si esta crema hidratante es unisex o solo para mujer, pero me da igual. ¡Es mía! Y no la voy a compartir 😬 Que se compren la suya, que hay mas a la venta 😂

Otras cosas tardo más tiempo en valorarlas, sobre todo suplementos, que aunque los vendedores quieren que valores las cosas al instante, suelo esperar varias semanas. Pero en este caso, la he recibido hoy, me he duchado 🚿 hace un rato y ya la he estrenado. 𝐘 𝐥𝐚𝐬 𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬 𝐧𝐨 𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐩𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐝𝐨 𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐦𝐞𝐣𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐬, 𝐲 𝐞𝐬𝐨 𝐪𝐮𝐞 𝐲𝐨 𝐬𝐨𝐲 𝐦𝐮𝐲 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐚́𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐚𝐬 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬, 𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐪𝐮𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐢 𝐭𝐨𝐝𝐚𝐬 𝐦𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐧 𝐦𝐮𝐲 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐨𝐬𝐚𝐬.

Como digo, hay cremas hidratantes muy famosas, que se venden mucho, en hipermercados y tiendas de perfumeria y que tienen incluso formatos de tamaño grande, que podrán hidratar mucho, pero para mi gusto la sensación que deja, no me compensa. Eso me lleva a que de vez en cuando, si no hay de la que suelo usar o no compro o compro una de las otras y al final la acabo regalando y de vez en cuando se me seca la piel.

Sin ir mas lejos este verano, ya he contado varias veces en reseñas de productos de colágeno, que nado todo el año 🏊‍♀ pero este verano me limite al protector solar la mayor parte del verano, y de tanto cloro acabe con la piel hecha polvo, toda reseca. A base de volver a usar cremas y colágeno, necesite unas 4 semanas para recuperar algo y 6 semanas para que tuviera el aspecto habitual.

Así que eso prueba que tengo tolerancia cero con las cremas hidratantes que “pringan” mucho, aunque hidraten bien y a otras personas les guste.

Al aplicarla, ya se nota una textura más suave y no tan densa y pringosa como otras, se seca bien y tiene un aroma agradable. Son 300 ml y no se cuanto me durara, aunque lo cierto es que se extiende muy bien y una pequeña cantidad cunde mucho. Mientras que con el otro tipo de cremas más pegajosas, son tan densas, que aunque aprietes suavemente suele salir un pegote gordo.

Obviamente comparada con todas esas cremas que tanto se venden y que tienen formatos de botes enormes, sale mas cara. Pero es que yo no puedo con esas cremas.

Esta hecha principalmente a base de Karité, que es conocida por una intensa hidratación, ayudar a proteger y regenerar la piel, e ingluso tiene propiedades antiinflamatorias que pueden ayudar a calmar la piel irritada. En teoría el Karité también ayuda en el proceso de cicatrización, estrias y varices, aunque esto ultimo, me imagino que serán productos mas especificos.

La verdad es que había oído y leído buenas cosas de los productos de cosmetica coreanos 🇰🇷 pero nunca había usado uno hasta ahora, y aunque obviamente habrá buenos y malos, de momento mi primera experiencia la pasa con nota.

✅👍 Crema hidratante de Karité. Buena hidratación, textura, no deja sensación pringosa y se extiende muy bien con poca cantidad.
✅👍 Aroma muy agradable.
✅👍 Producto coreano 🇰🇷 Cada vez se están haciendo mas populares los productos de cosmetica coreanos y se venden mas en occidente.
✅👍 Como se puede ver en una de las fotos 📸 la caja viene sellada con un precinto de plastico.

❓ No es la opción más barata. Pero no creo que sea justo que comparemos una crema de esta calidad, con otras mas baratas que vienen en botes gigantes. Es cierto que muchas de estas ultimas hidratan muy bien y se venden mucho. Si a ti te funcionan esas, entonces quizá no te merezca la pena gastar lo que cuesta este bote. Si eres de los mios y casi todas esas cremas te parecen muy densas y pringosas, entonces podrías darle una oportunidad."

La formulazione si presenta con:

1. Base principale:
• Water/Butylene Glycol in testa alla formula come base idratante
• Diversi derivati dell'etilesilglicole che fungono da emollienti

2. Elementi interessanti:
• Niacinamide (Vit. B3) - ottimo ingrediente per uniformare l'incarnato e ridurre i pori
• Glycerin - idratante base molto efficace
• Butyrospermum Parkii (Burro di Karitè) - emolliente naturale ricco

3. Conservanti e stabilizzanti:
• Diversi ingredienti tra cui etilesil stearato e polimeri che aiutano la stabilità della formula

La particolarità di questa formula è la presenza di:
• Derivati glucosidici che migliorano la texture
• Alcool grasso (non seccante) che aiuta la penetrazione degli attivi
• Presenza di ingredienti che suggeriscono una texture leggera ma nutriente

Nel complesso, sembra una formulazione moderna che bilancia ingredienti funzionali con una buona sensorialità. È orientata all'idratazione e al comfort sulla pelle, con alcuni attivi interessanti come la Niacinamide.

Il flacone ha il classico tappo a pressione ed è di plastica, non vetro.
La crema si presenta bianchissima e piuttosto densa.
Sulla pelle tende a creare una pellicola plasticosa che, sì offre morbidezza e idratazione, ma potrebbe dare fastidio se usata in quantità.
Non unge comunque, ma consiglierei di iniziare con piccolissime quantità su corpo e viso per vedere come ci si trova.

Peccato che ci siano indicazioni solo in lingua inglese, niente italiano (d’altronde il prodotto è Made in UK).
Al momento in cui scrivo il prezzo è di 27 euro, e mi pare congruo con la qualità e la quantità di crema offerta."

The selling point for me is the ease of absorption and the fact it doesn't leave any greasy residue on my skin and therefore doesn't transfer onto clothing.

Its moisturising capabilities are fantastic and, for example, I can feel the how it works on my elbows.
My elbows which were kind of rough and dry are currently extremely smooth and soft.
I can't believe it myself to be honest.

Das Design würde ich als clean bezeichnen. Die Lotion ist von der Konsistenz ist dünnflüssig, was ich von bisher benutzten Shea Butter Cremes nicht kannte, diese waren immer etwas zäh und nicht leicht zu entnehmen bzw. verteilen. Ich finde das hat PURITO gut gelöst. Die Bodylotion lässt sich gut verteilen und zieht schnell ein. Sie hinterlässt kein klebriges Gefühl. Vom Duft her habe ich mir ehrlich gesagt etwas anderes vorgestellt unter Cotton Dreamlight. Ich finde die Lotion hat einen Blumenduft. Habe ewig überlegt welche Blume es sein könnte, bis ich dann unter der näheren Beschreibung gesehen habe, dass beim Duft Orchidee, Freesie, Veilchen, Lilie, Alpen Veilchen und Magnolie als mittlere Note angeben ist. Ist überhaupt nicht mein persönlicher Geschmack, wer's gerne blumig mag, kann hier gerne zugreifen.
Die Pflegewirkung ist gut, für meine derzeit trockenen Schienbeine, dürfte es aber gerne noch reichhaltiger sein. Da der Preis bei 27€ (Stand 15.01.25) liegt, würde ich sie mit nicht noch einmal bestellen. Liegt in meinem Fall einfach an dem Duft und nicht am Produkt selbst."

Der Duft ist dezent, sehr angenehm, ich mag ihn. Nach dem Auftragen hält er noch etwas an. Die Bodylotion lässt sich leicht und gut auf der Haut auftragen, toll finde ich die Pumpvorrichtung. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass sie auch recht ergiebig ist. Nach dem Auftragen habe ich ein sehr angenehmes Hautgefühl. Die Lotion zieht sehr schnell ein.

Den Preis von 300 ml finde ich allerdings zu hoch. Für mich wäre mir das zu teuer, als Geschenk eignet es sich jedoch hervorragend."

I received the Cotton Dreamlight version which has a fairly bold floral scent with a hint of sandalwood and vanilla. I personally find it to be a bit too strong at first, but it does fade down once absorbed. It comes in a good sized 10.14 fluid ounce bottle and has an easy to use push pump dispenser. The lotion is a lightweight consistency that spreads easily meaning a little goes a long way. It does absorb nicely though it takes a bit longer than I typically prefer. No issues with irritation, reactions, or greasiness. I really like that this is a vegan body lotion that is made with allergy friendly fragrance. It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized, and I didn’t have to reapply it frequently like I have to do with others. The price point is on par with other products of the a similar size and ingredient profile. Overall, this does seem to be a nice lotion with a pleasant fragrance that isn’t overwhelming once fully absorbed leaving my skin feeling smooth and moisturized that lasts without any heaviness or greasiness.

J’ai particulièrement apprécié le flacon pompe pratique, qui délivre la juste quantité de produit à chaque utilisation. Le format de 300 ml est suffisant pour durer, même avec une application régulière sur tout le corps.

Côté parfum, bien que léger et subtil, il peut ne pas convenir à tout le monde, surtout si vous préférez les produits sans odeur ou aux notes plus neutres. Cependant, pour ma part, le parfum reste discret et agréable, un bon compromis pour un soin hydratant parfumé.

Seul petit regret : le prix, qui reste élevé pour une lotion corporelle, mais il reflète sans doute la qualité des ingrédients et la réputation de la marque. Si vous cherchez un produit efficace et agréable à utiliser, c’est une option à envisager, même si ce n’est pas révolutionnaire.

Questa crema della Purito mi ha conquistato, la sto alternando ad un’altra crema corpo loro con profumazione differente, tutte e 2 di altissima qualità.

Già dalla prima applicazione ha evidenziato un’ottima idratazione, la applico dopo la doccia, ha una buona consistenza ma diventa molto leggera appena viene applicata sulla pelle.

Dopo un leggero massaggio circolatorio si assorbe velocemente senza lasciare residui untuosi, idratando la pelle e lasciandola morbida, un effetto setoso.

Ps: ho provato questa e l’altra crema corpo sulle mani dove ho la pelle più rovinata e secca perché faccio fatica a mettere le creme mani, perché sono troppo grasse e mi danno fastidio per l’effetto unto che lasciano.
Queste invece si assorbono bene senza quel fastidioso effetto unto, dando subito morbidezza alle mani, mi hanno stupito.

Inoltre una piacevole profumazione non invadente ma persistente io percepisco una nota fiorita iniziale, legno di sandalo e una leggera vaniglia sul finale.

Non amo le creme corpo perché troppo spesso sono pesanti e lasciano residui fastidiosi sui vestiti o profumazioni poco accattivanti, al contrario queste della Purito invece le metto con piacere.
Quindi consiglio questa crema corpo perché mi ha conquistato.

I especially focus on ingredients which perform well rather than just packaging or marketing which often lead me to Asian skincare which is known for its performance. Purito is an excellent brand which I had heard rave reviews of but had not tried before so I was eager to spot this sampler set. Each of the steps in the kit is well-formulated and would be an excellent addition to anyone's skincare regimen.

Some of the great ingredients in this line include centella asiatica (aka cica) which is known to reduce inflammation / redness and has anti-aging properties, bamboo which increases the skin's moisture barrier, and panthenol which also increases skin's hydration.

Cleanser: a low-pH is important so that it doesn't disrupt the skin's natural pH balance and so that it doesn't strip the skin from too much moisture. This one is gentle but also effective. I personally have other cleansers that I prefer but would recommend this one if you haven't tried a low-pH cleanser before.

Toner: unlike western toners which can be harsh and abrasive, Asian toners focus on adding moisture back into skin after cleansing. I applied this toner directly with my hands so that I didn't waste any product. It soaked right into the skin, leaving it soft and supple. I don't have much redness so I can't attest to the anti-redness claims but with the centella asiatica ingredient, I would think that this should have calming effects.

Serum: this is a wonderful product which delivers the skincare benefits for the extended daytime / nighttime hours. It feels luxurious on the skin without being heavy. I would definitely continue using this product.

Panthenol Cream: this lotion also delivers similar benefits as the serum but in lotion format. As it is the winter season, I appreciate the additional moisturization and it felt rich and hydrating. It was lightweight which was perfect for my as my skin is on the oilier side.

Sun Lotion: as with many Asian sunscreens, this performed wonderfully! It didn't leave a white cast and didn't feel thick or heavy on my skin.

Overall, this is an amazing set as an introduction to Asin skincare, for travel, or as a sampler for Purito products. I would 100% recommend this!"

So far I've tried all but the sunblock (I work indoors all day so don't really need it). CLEANSER- I used this in the shower. Was a bit disappointed with the lather and had to use a bit more than I anticipated to get it to spread around my face enough. After rinsing it off, I was pleased to find that my skin actually felt softer and less dry compared to before applying it. TONER: I put this as the base layer. I had the hardest time just getting the toner to drip out of the bottle. I had to tap the bottle upside down on my finger each time to get any to come out. The toner absorbed easily, did not leave residue, and my skin felt like it was hydrated. SERUM: I applied this next. This bottle has a pump so it's much easier to get the product out. It's a bit more viscous than the toner. It applied and absorbed easily as well and left no residue. LOTION: I applied this last. It's from a tube squeeze type bottle. It's a thick white cream which applied and absorbed well into my skin. After applying all layers I felt that my skin was softer and more hydrated. I did not note any scent with anything I used, nor did I have any irritation or side effects."

More of a trial or travel size to see if you like. The exterior box has instructions in Korean and interior has English instructions.

No noticeable scent. No adverse reactions. Likely to replace with larger Purito components.

My suggestion would be to put a medium to large 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 on each container so somebody newer to full facial care doesn’t have to return to the box to figure out the order of application. It would also even help those with prescription glasses that have to take them off during application."

Unfortunately, it wasn't really for me. I felt the cleanser had an off-putting smell and found the toner just came out in little droplets. The moisturiser for me was a bit sticky and when applying it seemed to just sit on the top of the skin, and my face seemed quite tight. It was great to be able to try these little minis, see if they suit your skin before buying the larger sizes as everyone is different when it comes to these products. The kit itself is good value for money."

The serum and cream are really hydrating without being greasy, which I appreciate. Since it’s winter, I’ve been using the panthenol cream for that extra boost of moisture. It’s rich but light enough that it doesn’t weigh down my skin. The sun lotion worked great too, not leaving that white cast like some sunscreens do.

Sono stata felicissima quindi di provare queste versioni da viaggio, che ti consentono di avere una routine di skincare completa (tranne il contorno occhi... Ma c'è addirittura la crema solare, per dire) comoda da portarsi in giro o in borsa, o, semplicemente, utile per capire se questi prodotti facciano o meno al caso nostro.
I formati sono piccolini, è vero, ma, a mio avviso, sufficienti. Arrivano sigillati e questa cosa va apprezzata.
Sono molto, molto delicati, alcuni inodori, e in generale abbastanza adatti ad ogni tipo di pelle. Il siero e la crema risultano un pochino pesanti per pelle grassa e non li consiglierei d'estate (a meno di non usare la crema come crema notte), ma penso che gli altri tipi di pelle non avranno problemi. A tal proposito: per la pelle grassa io consiglio, se volete restare nella linea alla Centella, il siero versione profumata - che tra l'altro sa di lavanda e lo amo - , perché è più leggero di questo non profumato. Ottimo e delicatissimo il detergente, di quelli che io alterno ai detergenti specifici per il mio tipo di pelle. Ottimo e altrettanto delicato il tonico. In generale questi prodotti sono il connubio di due linee: quella con la centella asiatica e quella col pantenolo e bambù, adattissime alle pelli anche più sensibili, protettivi e antiarrossamento.
Skincare di livello che vi consiglio di provare, e con questo set potrete averne un gran bell'assaggino. ;)"

Quitando eso parece un producto de calidad, recién lo acabo de empezar a usar y creo que si no es a largo plazo será difícil el poder ver si realmente da resultados, soy bastante crítico con esto.

Otro punto negativo es el que está todo en inglés, que para algunas personas puede ser un problema, aunque es bastante fácil saber qué es cada cosa, pero lo dicho, está todo en inglés.

De momento me gusta como se sienten en la piel estos productos, seguiré usándolos."

This is the perfect way to get an idea of how a product line will work for you. If it's already in your potion cabinet, this can be a travel kit. With so many potions out there, it is difficult for a newly concerned about skin care person to navigate the maze. One line, step by step, no confusion. And when you're done, you and your skin feel pampered.

This set targets the needs of most women, using well known effective ingredients. I have normal skin, but some redness and occasional puffiness that need attention. My favorite is the sunscreen included in the kit. It's an added layer of moisture and protection before I decide if it's a makeup day or not. I'm 100% happy with all of the products in this travel/sampler kit."

Purito ist eine aufstrebende koreanische Marke mit veganer und tierversuchsfreier Kosmetik
Das Kit beinhaltet eine Reinigung, einen Toner, ein Serum, eine Creme und ein Sonnenschutzmittel in Reisegröße.
Die koreanischen Produkte beruhigen die Haut, während die Bambusformeln die Haut mit Feuchtigkeit versorgen.
Die Produkte sind ohne Duftstoffe.
Ich mag besonders die Creme, sie spendet, gerade jetzt im Winter, sehr viel Feuchtigkeit und die Haut ist geschmeidig und fühlt sich gut an.
Die anderen Produkte pflegen die Haut ebenfalls sehr gut und schützen sie vorm Austrocknen.
Die Sonnenschutzcreme habe ich noch nicht getestet.
Ich finde die Pflegeprodukte insgesamt sehr gut, deshalb eine klare Kaufempfehlung."

This is a lovely little travel set, and having sampled all but the sun cream (as it's just not the appropriate weather to test), they're great - not too oily, tacky/sticky, and absorbs into the skin very well. It is scent-less, and is also very gentle on sensitive skin which my partner has, particularly around the nose.

This makes not only a good travel kit, but lovely little gift!"

⭐️ 1 star - I don't recommend it at all, poor quality, or it does not reflect the advertising.
⭐️⭐️ 2 stars - I don't recommend it, it has multiple faults, or is not priced where it should be for the product.
⭐️⭐️⭐️ 3 stars - It's passable. It has some faults, but the quality is adequate for what it is.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 4 stars - Product quite acceptable; it does what it promises.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5 stars - Product that I totally recommend."

So I jumped at the chance to try this sampler. With everything you need for your skin care routine, perfect if you're new to Purito and just want to try everything. Or if you're looking for a skin friendly travel kit for all those beachy or ski destinations, this is a great choice as it even contains a sun lotion. I would have loved to have this kit on vacation when I forgot to reapply my sunscreen and got a burn on my face. I use it the bamboo face lotion when my skin is irritated from too many chemical processes and peels but it would probably be just as soothing on skin with too much sun or wind. Great products."

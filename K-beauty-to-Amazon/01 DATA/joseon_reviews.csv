I have the rice mask and just purchased these as well. Oh my god! My skin loves it. It doesn't irritate or burn, makes my skin dewy and tightened my pores. I didn't notice a smell but I don't have the strongest nose.

The only thing I don't like is the fit of the mask. It's almost like they cut the holes a bit off.. either way there's plenty of it to stretch and move around to fit everything.

Doesn't change my opinion though, this will be a staple for me"

There is no structure and removing the plastic from the mask is incredible hard. The serum is thick and makes the mask stick together and makes it impossible to detach from itself. It’s not true to any face structure at all and I have to cut the mouth piece so it fits on my face. Will not purchase thus again.

Not sure about the ""calming"" aspect but it is not meant for dry skin. Tried this 3 nights in a row, and my face absorbed all the serum/moisture after about 7 minutes and still looked super dry the next morning. Maybe it is meant for people with oily skin or only meant to be used in the summer month?"

My experiences with this:
It does calm my face and it is moisturizing.
It doesn't burn or irritate my sensitive skin.
I like that it has little or no overpowering or noticeable scent even after I am done with the mask.
After I remove it from my face my face is not sticky where i have to wash my face before sleeping
I like the paper that the mask is on because it makes it easier to open up the mask from the packet and put it on my face.
I like the its a 10 pack and that is a value. I get my husband another brand face mask and its sold in single packets only so its really inconvenient to remember to order them.
These masks is so good that i would definitely look into trying their other products."

I’ve been using it once a week and it’s really hydrating. The first time I left it on for about 20ish minutes, and felt that my skin was left slightly more hydrated, but nothing a serum couldn’t do. The next time I left the mask on for 30+ minutes and definitely felt that my skin was left more hydrated than before, and it seemed to last well into the next day. Centella is known to be a calming, soothing compound that reduces redness, but I don’t think there is enough of it in this product to get its full benefits. When using a centella mask, I want the highest amount possible to reduce the redness in my skin. However, it is pretty hydrating. I will be trying out other mask brands, but I don’t know if I plan to repurchase this again."

There is plenty of product in the envelope so I put it in the fridge and re-use within 24 hours. BOJ also has the best Gua Sha (gwalsa) out there, too, which works well with their products. It’s porcelain and not jade. The shape works better for massaging my face (and body). Highly recommend both. Yes, BOJ is one of my favorite brands. I use several of their products.

No matter if I use my microdermabrasion before, this formula it leaves a thick sticky residue on your skin. I waited forever to see if it absorbs and it doesn’t. It just sits on the skin. It does not leave my face looking or feeling fresh and hydrated. Would definitely skip/pass on this one. I have combo skin, leaning more dry overall."

I use this mask weekly & it calms & hydrates skin. My only criticism of this is that the masks are very small. They don’t fit my forehead very well & seem to be sized for someone with a fairly small face. That said, I just smooth some of the essence from the mask onto the parts it doesn’t reach to & that works just fine for me."

Other notable ingredients include Niacinamide, Arginine, Adenosine, pantheon and may root/plant extract which are highly beneficial for all skin types.

But thanks to my amazing girlfriend (who's way ahead of me in the skincare game), I've discovered the wonders of K-beauty, starting with this Beauty of Joseon Glow Serum. It's a revelation.

Here's why I'm glowing about this serum:

Hydration without the Heavies: This serum is like water for my skin. It absorbs quickly, leaving my face hydrated and refreshed without any greasy residue. This is a welcome change for someone who's used to that tight, dry feeling due to living at a high altitude.

Glow-Up Achieved: I've been using this serum for a few weeks now, and I can honestly say my skin looks brighter and healthier. It's got a subtle glow that I haven't seen in years, and even my girlfriend has commented on how much better my skin looks.

Soothes and Calms: I have sensitive skin prone to redness, but this serum has been incredibly gentle. It seems to calm any irritation and leave my skin feeling soothed.

Lightweight and Layerable: The lightweight texture absorbs quickly, making it perfect for layering under moisturizer and sunscreen. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy, which is a big plus.

Intriguing Ingredients: The combination of propolis and niacinamide is fascinating. I'm not a skincare expert (yet!), but I've learned that these ingredients are known for their soothing, brightening, and anti-inflammatory properties.

A Few Minor Considerations: While I'm thoroughly impressed with this serum, there are a couple of things to keep in mind based on other reviews:

Slight Stickiness: Some users mentioned a slight stickiness immediately after the application. I've noticed this, but it disappears quickly as the serum absorbs.

Not a Miracle Cure: While this serum has improved my skin's hydration and overall appearance, it's not a magic wand that will erase years of neglect overnight. Consistent use and a good overall skincare routine are key.

Overall: If you're looking for a hydrating, brightening, and soothing serum that's gentle on sensitive skin, the Beauty of Joseon Glow Serum is a fantastic choice. It's been a game-changer for my skin, and I highly recommend it to anyone, especially fellow middle-aged guys new to the skincare world (and taking recommendations from their awesome girlfriends)."

I am in my 60’s and have mild rosacea (redness) and extremely sensitive skin. There are very few products I can use so my skincare routine is limited. I started using the Glow Serum a month ago and I am shocked at how it has improved the look and feel of my skin. I put this on after cleansing and it feels amazing. I experienced none of the reactions I usually do from products such as itching, burning, and red bumps. I follow with the one moisturizer I can use morning and evening. When I wake up in the morning my skin looks and feels calm and yes, it’s glowing! It has never looked this good! I can even leave the house make up free now. I ordered some for my 35 year old daughter and she loves it too. When my overly expensive moisturizer starts running low I think I will try the Dynasty Cream and will hope for a similar experience. The other benefit of BOJ is the products are reasonably priced. I have already purchased another bottle even though I still have half remaining after a month of use because I don’t ever want to be without it. I hope they never stop making this serum!"

However, long-term wise it doesn’t help with the skin barrier and doesn’t do the job as consistently well as I had expected.

I would love to take a bath in it....just kidding, but it does make me feel like a million bucks. I can't wait to use it morning and evening for a month and then see how it feels and looks. If it stays the same I will still be delighted with it. I know that Korean products are exceptional and I am leaning towards more Korean products because I believe in the effectiveness of everything that I have tried so far.

Korean Moisturizing Skin Care for Men and Women 150ml, 5 fl.oz","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","I really do not do reviews but in this case I feel like I have to, to warn people have sensitive skin to be careful if they want to try this skincare line. I ordered my first beauty of Joseon last year I got the ginseng toner, the cleanser and the serum that goes with it. Up on using the product I felt that my skin is healthy and glowing and clear then it have ever been. And to make it clear I have a hyper sensitive skin and on top of that I have eczema so my skin can flare up anytime if it wants to or if I use something that irritates it. Since I use the products for a year everything was doing fine everything was perfect I'm loving the product there's no problem with it my skin is loving it not until the beginning of this year all of a sudden my face broke out. My face started to itch I thought it was just itchy but when I look at it on the mirror I see some redness on my skin and some rash, so basically my face was flaring up but I did not blame it to the skincare that I was using because like I said a year prior everything was perfect so I thought it's just my skin doing its thing and it's going to go away. So I stopped using the skin care line until my face was fully healed so that was about June when my face finally healed from the flare-up that I had from the beginning of the this year. I didn't use the toner because I ran out, but I still have the oil based cleanser and I'm being using it on and off and my face is okay it didn't flare up it no allergic reaction or anything like that. decided to reorder the toner Plus the light vitamin C serum and got delivered yesterday, so I opened up the new bottle of toner and the vitamin C light serum and use it exactly at 9:40 p.m.. but when 3:00 a.m. came left corner of my lips was kind of itchy so I checked it out on the mirror and it was red and I was praying in my heart that it wasn't from the toner and the term that I used prior before going to work. But as the morning progress the T-Zone area on my face flared up now it have a full-blown allergic reaction it have this small type of rash and it's red and it's itchy. So I am sad to say I am discontinuing using the toner and serum. before knowing that the cause of my previous allergic reaction was this skin care line I reordered the snail serum as well because I was using that last year and I really like the results. Now I'm sad because not only did I feel like I wasted my money now I don't know what to do with this brand new products especially the snail serum that is going to be delivered tomorrow.
So in conclusion for all of the people who have sensitive skin and their skin can be easily irritated please be careful before buying this or any type of skin care. Just make myself clear I'm not saying the product is not good because like I said I love the product and it worked on me last year when i got it."

I ordered this toner not knowing what it would exactly do to my skin but it actually hydrates my skin a lot.

The texture is very light too so it does not feel heavy when you have a long skincare routine.

I've been using it for a few weeks and I'm very happy with the hydration it gives me at night before going to bed. I pat it in gently and follow with my moisturizer and retinol. It is refreshing and my skin has had no irritation to it. There is a slight scent, but it doesn't bother me at all. I also love that it's going to last for such a long time and only takes a few drops to use on your face and neck."

My skin was uneven, pigmented and a little dry from too much sun. So based on the good reviews I thought I'd give this a try. After about two weeks of using this twice daily, I can't believe how bright and plump my skin looks and feels. You do have to get used to the earthy smell and the texture is sort of slippery and sits on your skin but once it dries it's weightless. I top it off with Jumiso All Day Vit brightening serum and started both at the same time so tbh I'm not sure if it's the toner, serum or combination. In any case it works. Note that it does not lighten your skin just evens out darkish areas so you can still see my freckles but for some reason my skin glows. :) It comes in a cool thick plastic bottle which makes you wonder why Asian packaging is so awesome yet affordable."

Obviously I wouldnt have purchased if i knew this was a possible side effect, but even just about 30 seconds after use my skin became inflamed and I started to feel a burning sensation. The more white parts you can see in the photos are my natural skin tone and this is 2 minutes after applying as directed.

PLEASE DONT USE IF YOU HAVE A KNOWN HISTORY OF NIACIN REACTIONS !!

Disappointed because I love trying new skin products but im not sure why a company would use an ingredient that has inflaming properties on a facial skincare product. Niacin flush is a well documented side affect for a large portion of the population, so please be aware of the affect this could have on your skin."

I know what I’m doing, and I’ve NEVER had this happen after using a product once.

I used this enzyme last night for the first time and followed it with my usual routine, no other new products. I woke up with this rash on both cheeks and forehead. I know this product is the culprit because I only used it on my face, whereas all my other products I carry down my neck and chest. My neck and chest are clear.

I reviewed the ingredients before purchasing, I know I’m not allergic to any of them. A gommage(enzyme exfoliant) is typically less aggressive than a physical face scrub, so maybe I got a bad batch? No other harsh products were used in the same routine.

My professional opinion? Don’t buy this, if it’s irritating the skin of someone who works in the industry then theres something amiss. I hope I can return but obviously I did open and use it."

On clean, damp skin, you apply it with a gentle circular motion, avoiding the eye area. ALL the dead, dry skin will come off in your hand! It’s like a chemical peel without the pain and inconvenience. If you have actinic keratosis (dry, flaky patches) your face, this will smooth them out. It’s no substitute for a dermatologist, and those patches can turn into skin cancer, but it’s hard to cover them even with concealer. I use this twice a week, I’m 65, and the sun damage on my face is pretty bad. This is much gentler than a gritty scrub, and works so much better. My skin is so soft afterwards.

This stuff is like a time machine in a bottle! It's literally taking years off of my face!! I've used it twice now, and each time, I'm so impressed at how soft my face feels.

As soon as I start rubbing it in, small balls of dead skin start sloughing off. It's exactly like using one of those cheese graters on your feet during a pedicure (gross, but true). I find it very satisfying, like ""YES, TAKE THAT DEAD SKIN WITH YOU!""

I do feel a bit of redness and warmth after each use, and I am sure to moisturize very well afterwards.

The Beauty of Joseon Apricot Blossom Peeling Gel has become my holy grail for skin exfoliation. It's not your typical scrub; this gel is uniquely formulated to provide an exceptional exfoliating experience for both face and body.

The Good:
Unique Exfoliation: Unlike scrubs with harsh granules, this peeling gel uses small, textured elements that gently lift off dead skin cells without any abrasiveness. The sensation is akin to watching dead skin peel away, leaving your skin feeling rejuvenated.
Efficacy: After using this product, my skin feels as smooth and clean as post-Sonicare brushing, but for the face and body. It's gentle yet effective, making it perfect for sensitive skin types or those who prefer a less aggressive approach to exfoliation.
Gentle Formula: The inclusion of natural ingredients like Apricot Blossom extract adds a nourishing aspect to the exfoliation process, enhancing hydration and leaving skin not just exfoliated but also soothed.
Versatility: Suitable for both face and body, this product maximizes utility, making it a staple in my skincare routine.

The Not-So-Good:
Really, It's Hard to Find Flaws: If I had to nitpick, I might mention that the texture might not appeal to everyone since it's different from traditional scrubs, but that's more about preference than a flaw.

Overall:
This exfoliating gel from Beauty of Joseon has transformed my skincare routine. It's now my go-to product for that clean, smooth skin feeling without the irritation that sometimes comes with other exfoliants. If you're seeking a must-try exfoliator that feels like a gentle yet thorough cleanse, this is it.

Pros:
Innovative texture for effective, gentle exfoliation
Leaves skin feeling incredibly smooth and clean
Suitable for sensitive skin
Works for both face and body

Cons:
The unique feel might not appeal to everyone accustomed to traditional scrubs

Conclusion:
If you're in the market for an exfoliator that feels like a treat rather than a chore, the Beauty of Joseon Apricot Blossom Peeling Gel should be at the top of your list. It's like giving your skin the Sonicare treatment, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone looking to elevate their skincare game."

Then I wash it off and immediately apply my preferred active (in my case, the retinoid adapalene). I find it gives the retinoid especially good skin access, since it removes dead cells. A benefit of this exfoliant being extra gentle is that it means I’m not having to apply my retinoid over irritated skin, which in my case means I’m able to repeat this routine every night. It’s not recommended to use it that frequently, and maybe you really shouldn’t, but that’s what I do regardless and my skin looks really smooth and pretty.

It's just the texture that still throws me off a bit even after I've used it many times already. It kind of balls up and it feels like you're pushing those little balls around your face. I find it awkward to use, but that is almost certainly because I am new to this type of product. It works very well and my skin seems to love it, so that's all that really matters.

I'm not as sure how I felt about the actual peeling mechanism of the gel, as i feel like it never peels in layers and it pills more instead, which is kind of annoying to me because I'm not a fan of things sticking to my hands when I'm doing my skincare. However, This exfoliant did not strip my skin in a harsh way, but still left it feeling like it was cleared up of dead skin and gunk afterwards. It actually did exfoliate me quite gently and effectively, as a pleasant surprise. For that being it's main function, i rated it higher. This is a good product to get the job done without skin barrier damage."

I was expecting this product to be a mask. I was expecting the kind of mask that gets peeled off after it dries, taking all the surface dead skin off with it. This isn’t that. This is what I would call a scrub for your face. It is like a liquid soap with granules that exfoliate your skin as you wash.

Even though it wasn’t what I was expecting, I really like the way this makes my skin feel. Most scrubs are drying. This isn’t. My skin feels smooth, clean, and moisturized, hours after using it."

I easily break out when my skin is overstripped or the barrier is compromised in any way. For years I have been unable to use any cleanser that is foaming or sudsing in any way and have had to use only lotion type cleansers. I thought I would try this as I love other products from this line and the price was very reasonable. I am so surprised to say that I have been able to use this twice a day for so long that I went through an entire bar and bought two more! It foams nicely, and I have missed being able to use a foamy cleanser. The lather/foam it creates is thick and sift, and while it does leave my face a bit dry and tight, it has caused zero irritation or compromise to my skin barrier. I always follow with toners, essences, serums, and moisturizers regardless of my cleanser, so the initial tightness is not bothersome. While it does dry a bit, it doesn’t seem to actually dehydrate my skin. Best of all, it keeps my skin clear and bright better than almost any cleanser I have ever used. I am so shocked by this bar, not at all what I expect from this type of soap. So pleased!!"

My skin's been relatively decent forever but my hormones have been terrible lately. I woke up and it was almost like my skin's barrier was gone and I kept getting cystic acne. For reference, I'm 26, and this was completely out of the blue. However, I've always had overly red cheeks (not rosacea but just thin skin), I thought maybe there'd be WAY to change that. Nope! The Glow Deep Serum and the Calm Serum changed the game! My face is evening out by the day. And the GLOW. I told my best friend, ""I literally wear a full face of makeup every day of my life and I truly love my skin and I feel like I really almost don't need it. This is CRAZY.""

First pic: No Makeup the lip product is a lip mask from Bath and body works
Second Pic: Makeup but you can see the glow from underneath AND you can see how hydrated my skin is and the texture improving. Unfortunate I didn't take any pictures when my skin was dying but. YES. get this.

My full routine:

Double Cleanse:
- Beekman 1802's Milk Wash Exfoliating Jelly (Cleanse alone with this and if you have sensitive skin you will fight me later. My skin hated me at first until I combined the Cetaphil but it wasn't nearly as bad as aveeno's ""sensitive"" skin line. That brand and facewash is TERRIBLE.
- Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser (My fav and so cheap)
Toner:
-The Saem ""Drop Be"" (Purchased when I went to Busan last winter but you can find it on Ebay)
Serums: I use all four of these- I introduced two then four at a time to address problem areas.
Face Mask:
-Mediheal ( My favorites are the Collagen ones and the WaterMide as they don't irritate my sensitive AF skin at all)
Eye Mask:
-Florence (the purple ones for undereye bags) Absolutely obsessed because I have terrible
undereye bags thanks to genetics. The definitely help with puffiness and discoloration. I've been using them for months now.
Lip scrub/Lip Mask:
-Bath and body works vanilla (so good I want a different one though since I like brand exploration but it's SO hydrating and it is great for a no-makeup clean girl look)
Barrier Cream/Skin life changer x2:
-ETUDE Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream Hypoallergenic"

My take on the four included are: 2 out of three of them are very sticky and feel terrible on the skin. I would absolutely pass on the Glow Deep Serum because of the tacky sticky grossness of it. I dont care how good it is, it never absorbs and just sits on top of your skin. The second worse was the Revive serum, it was also very sticky and never really dries or absorbs into the skin.

The two that I liked were the Green Tea and Panthenol as well as the Glow Serum with Propolis and Niacinamide. The green tea one absorbed nicely into the skin. The regular glow serum with propolis and Niacinamide was also pretty nice. It had a little bit of a tacky feeling but absorbed nicely into the skin after a little while.

None of them broke me out or made my skin turn red with a patch test on my arm. I would reorder the ladder two. None of them had much of a smell at all either which I really liked. I cant stand fragrances so that was a plus."

And it took almost a week to get rid of it.

It's aging at a rapid rate. I have combination skin, it doesn't know whether it's oily or dry depending on the week. I've heard so many good things about Korean skincare.. so I MUST TRY IT!
First off I've used a different product each time, trying to figure out which one will suit me so I can buy that ONE next time. I will say it definitely hydrates, it's mild-moderately sticky. Texture is smooth/matte. And it's slightly heavy. I've noticed an increase in my blackheads. (I am one who cannot leave zits and such just chilling on my face. So I've been picking more. ) There weren't directions with the product--just labeling for the ingredients. But I'm guessing the soothing green tea one is best for my inflamed skin."

It doesn't exactly do that: it doesn't get rid of any sun spots, dark spots, whatever spots you have on your face. It does provide some moisturizing effect, but it leaves your face feeling sticky.

Unfortunately serving as a harbinger for the health problems underlying its condition.

And while I'm still knee deep in identifying all the moving parts of my health problems.

My hope was to at least be able to calm my wildly reactive skin at the surface level.

This luxurious cleansing balm breaks down the day's buildup and rinses so beautifully that I've used it for both face and body as all of the skin on this sweet body has become *practically* hydrophobic.

For the face, I use this as part of a double cleanse with a brilliant enzymatic rice powder that turns into this lovely marshmallow-y cleanser.

And finish with a rice cream moisturizer to seal in the feeling of gently exfoliated, baby soft skin.

Rice skincare has been an absolute game-changer for me and my dry, flaky, rosacea-prone, eczema-prone skin.

Hoping next to switch out my witch hazel and mineral sunscreen for a rice-based toner and rice-based sunscreen formulated for dry skin... yes, they do exist <3

K-beauty products for the win!"

It's a solid choice and everything washes off easily without leaving any residue. This didn't break me out, but I did sometimes get the ""squeaky clean"" feeling after using this. I am someone who likes really massaging in my cleansing balms so that might play a role in it. It gets a lot of blackheads/clears my pores. It really does a good job getting everything, but since I'm not really wearing that much, this is a pass for me. I took this camping with me and it was the best thing for getting off the grime from camp/campfire smoke/all the layers of sunscreen though. If you need a heavy-duty cleansing balm, this is a great option."

The only thing was Lilah B had a strong fragrance added, but it was a beautiful fragrance so I didn't mind.

I haven't found one that matched that perfect feeling of spreading on my facial skin smoothly and then turning to a beautiful oil-like texture and then washing away cleanly. I'm sure they are out there, I just didn't find one that I liked or compared to LB. Until this Beauty of Joseon cleansing balm!

I do love everything BOJ, so I am biased :) but this cleansing balm goes on so beautifully, spreads easily, and turns to a gorgeous texture on my skin. Easy to wash away. No fragrance, which is great if you have sensitive skin.

I don't double cleanse in the morning - I use BOJ ginger cleansing oil, which I also love as it cleans my face without drying it out. But, when I wear sunscreen and/or makeup, I will double cleanse. I use this balm first and then follow up with their Green Plum cleansing gel.

I have slight rosacea-prone skin and this does not irritate it. In face, the BOJ line is helping my rosacea - in particular their green tea serum calms the redness (along with CosRx snail mucin -gross but effective!).

And the price is so reasonable like all of BOJ products.

I need to order backups!"

I'm a guy so I wasn't looking to remove a lot of make-up or anything just a cleansing option that's super moisturizing for my dry skin especially as I'm getting older and seeing more lines. It leaves your skin feeling clean but soft and hydrated. My only complaint is that I started to get more breakouts and large pimples after a month or so of using it. I never break but it's kind of a given with a balmy product like this and my skin but it was great while it lasted. I guess I'm just meant to look old and dry if I don't want acne/breakouts.

A dermatologist recommended this eye cream for its moisturizing and non-pore–clogging abilities. She actually said while it was an eye cream, you could use on your whole face. I use one pump on my whole face morning and night

I don't know if it's the eye cream or the whole skincare revamp, but I've gotten a ridiculous amount of compliments on my skin. Two separate friends I hadn't seen in a couple of months asked me to send them instructions to my regimen! I chalk it up to three things: this eye cream for sure; Naked and Thriving's Renew night serum; and finishing my skincare routine with pure squalane oil to lock in the treatments.

This eye cream is a keeper for me. It's reasonably priced, feels really good on my skin, and it doesn't cause me any milia problems. I recommend it!"

If you use this, do not put it under your eyes. The skin around that area is sensitive, and I don't recommend using it daily like it says. Use it at least two (2) times a week AND use sunscreen when going out because of the use of retinal you can get sunburnt."

This is a very lightweight serum. I would almost call it an essence. I use this as one of my first steps after cleansing and toning.

I have Type 1 Rosacea, and this doesn't irritate my skin, and it does feel calming to my skin. Does it take away redness?--it may somewhat, but it does help to calm it before I go on to the rest of my skincare.

This along with their glow serums give my face that nice healthy glow. Not the greasy or oily 'faux glow' that some serums give, but a real healthy glow.

I also like their ginseng cleansing oil and their ginseng essence water.

BOJ is so gentle - no fragrances - cruelty-fee; just a lovely brand!"

UPDATE:
When I ran out of this serum, I tried a couple of others including Skin1004 and PURITO, which I must report neither got the job done for me the way this Beauty of Joseon Calming serum did. I have combination skin that varies from resilient to sensitive depending on the seasons, but no matter what, is always red. I use half a dropper full of this BoJ Calming serum and I’m good all day. They may as well rename it “redness be gone”! Definitely stocking up on it, and never going back to the others!"

I've used this consistently for about 3 weeks now and i've seen such huge improves in my skin's texture and complextion. I pat this on my skin after i wash my face and then i layer it with a light moisturizer and oil. I feel like my skin is supple and bright the next day! It reduces my blemishs but it doesnt completely take them away. I love the texture of this product and i love that it has no scent. I have eczema as well and it doesn't flare it up. I think this is a pretty affordable serum so I think it's worth trying as long as you stay consistent so you can see the results :)

I have always had sensitive skin. I have battled eczema and rashes that no doctor could diagnose. About 6 years ago I constantly had the rash in the last photo on and off. It burned and itched and felt like I had hundreds of blisters on my face. My dermatologist prescribed me steroids and steroid creams (not great because it thins your skin out over time). I’ve done extensive allergy tests with no answer to what causes this.

I just turned 32 and desperately want to be a skincare girly. But the only things I could use on my face were okay sensitive face wash and Aveeno baby lavender lotion! Anything else has caused me to have a reaction. Even makeup wipes would send my skin into a frenzy and I’d end up at the doctors office.

I’ve been doing research and wanted to use things that fellow sensitive skin people have tried with success. Along with reading extensive reviews. I decided to try this product and I am happy to say that I will be purchasing again! There is no stinging, burning or itching of any kind! I mean JUST LOOK AT MY GLOWING SKIN!"

However, after i finished the entire thing, i do kinda miss it. It’s one of those “you don’t know until it’s gone” for me. It reminds me of an aloe vera gel but it has a bit more tack and viscosity. I do love the glow it gives me, and it’s life a no frills moisturizer except there’s red bean benefits and peptides. My skin feels plump and hydrated and calm each time i used it, and my oily acne skin does appreciate it. I hated how it was tacky for a while until it completely absorbed. I might get it again in the future but for now, i want to continue to experiment with others. I do miss it lol."

FINALLY.

I have dehydrated skin: dry and oily (not combo). Been searching for 20 ANOS for a moisturizer that is gel form, water based, light and highly moisturizing WITHOUT making me oily hours later.

AND FRAGRANCE FREE. Because lets face it, any company adding fragrance to their moisturizer has IMMEDIATELY lost all credibility....its their way to say ""we dont gaf what your skin absorbs""

I lightly dampen my skin after my serums and rub this silky, velvety, loveliness into my skin

Im also using Rx Retinol which makes you flaky at first. No matter how much of this stuff i use to contain the flakiness, IT STILL NEVER MAKES ME OILY!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!

And yall, speaking of retinol - stop buying it

Studies prove OTC strength retinol is NOT effective. Manufacturers know this. Its all a scam. So call your regular doc right now and have them phone in an Rx for either the cream or gel retinol.

I promise it works amazingly."

While I still love tatcha, I did not love the continuously raising prices and found this while looking for something with similar benefits without the outrageous price tag. New holy grail! I have extremely sensitive oily, acne prone skin that cannot use acids (salicylic causes cystic responses all over my face and Hyaluronic gives me white heads everywhere), so I was skeptical. I've been using this for over 6 weeks now and my skin is clear and hydrated, not oily! If you're looking for a replacement for the leading expensive competitor and you have similar skin to mine, this is it! I use this under my SPF and makeup even with no issues."

If you’re someone who does their makeup right after their skincare, I would wait a good long while after applying this to do your makeup when it isn’t sticky. I was using this at night but it took too long to dry down and I could feel my cheek sticking to my pillow slightly, so I switched to using it in the morning and I use a different moisturizer at night.

While I can’t say it did wonders on my blackheads and/or pores (since I haven’t used it long enough yet to comment on), what did work was on an angry pimple I had smack dab on the forehead. I have combo skin and endless blackheads but rarely do I get pimples. If I happen to get a blemish, it’ll get zapped with Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Spot Gel before it becomes anything larger. This particular pimple I had was an angry one which given a bit of time became pus-filled. Since I had this mask in my arsenal, I decided to give it a shot. It definitely brought the white pus to the surface which left me with no choice but to drain it - all this while instantly brightening up my face and leaving me with a gorgeous glow. This mask and that of Beauty of Joseon’s honey oatmeal version worked beautifully in conjunction on my skin and with solving this pimple. I used the latter a day later to calm down the inflammation and in no time, the dark spot left from the pimple was dissolved. Sure, there’s still a remnant left of a dark spot but I’ll continue busting the issue with these two masks and I have high hopes it’ll take care of the minor mark. This only took me two days to resolve - red bean pore mask on one day and the honey oatmeal mask on another. That’s quite the track record and I wasn’t expecting any promising results at all! Highly, highly recommend."

This is not for combination. Skin does not work that well on it. If your skin is oily due to make up, this is not the product for you. I use this to minimize my pores.. it works, wonders it leaves my skin, soft and moisturized without the oily shine that I normally have. It lasts for an extremely long amount of time for the size of the container. I am happy with the product. I have been using their products for a while. I am 38 years old and I have always had extremely oily skin. I didn’t buy this because of TikTok. I bought this because I was looking for something that would help remove oil.
So I’ve read on some of the reviews people say that it smells bad. I think it smells like bean paste. It doesn’t really have a clay texture because I also have clay masks, and I can feel the difference at the texture. For me, it does not sting my face unlike when I do my clay mask with apple cider vinegar. I can feel that one tightening my face. This one is a soothing oil remover that I sometimes forget I have on my face. I can walk around my whole house with it on and wash it off after 10 minutes sometimes I leave it on longer cause like I said I forget that it’s there.
I would recommend this every single time. I have my I would never recommend this for someone who has dry skin or normal skin cause this would probably dry you out so much that it would cause you to get more acne.
So I will emphasize to definitely know your skin type."

It comes with it’s own tiny spatula.
I believe quality and quantity wise, the price is perfect. You’re supposed to apply it, I think it’s between 2-3 times a week, and the amount you need to put on your face to see results is small, so I’m expecting it to last several months.

As someone with oily skin, I’m always on the lookout for products that purify without leaving my skin feeling stripped, and this mask delivers perfectly.

The formula is enriched with red bean extract, which is known for its antioxidant properties. The texture is smooth with a gentle, grainy consistency—enough to provide light exfoliation but not so rough that it irritates. Applying it feels like a mini spa experience; the mask spreads easily and has a natural, earthy scent that’s soothing without being overwhelming.

I left it on for about 10 minutes, during which it didn’t dry out uncomfortably like some clay masks do. Washing it off was easy, and I loved the slight scrubbing effect as I rinsed. The results were immediate—my skin felt clean, refreshed, and soft, with noticeably minimized pores around my T-zone.

What I appreciate most is that, unlike many pore-focused masks, it didn’t leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my face felt balanced, as if it had just hit the reset button.

This mask is perfect for weekly use, especially if you’re dealing with congestion or dullness. The Beauty of Joseon Red Bean Mask combines tradition with modern skincare needs beautifully, making it a must-try for anyone seeking gentle yet effective pore care."

I took a chance on this one - I was skeptical of the beads - but they were extremely soft and non-abrasive like the apricot scrubs, etc. The mask came with a spatula (smaller than imagined, but it’s the perfect size) most masks don’t come with one so that was bonus points already! It went on so smoothly & didn’t burn or irritate my skin. I left it on for 13 minutes & it seemed to work great, I might try 14 minutes next time. It washed off pretty easily, the beads were did come off into the sink but easily washed away. The best part…. It didn’t make my skin feel dry or tight once I washed it off! I got busy for about ten minutes after taking it off and my skin didn’t feel tight AT ALL.

Also, my biggest pores are in between my eyebrows but generally my t-zone. I’m not kidding when I say they were visibly smaller afterwards. Not completely “gone” obviously but significantly smaller. I felt so clean after. 10000000/10 I love this mask so far!"

When I first tried it on my hand, it smelled nice and I even did not know it had artificial fragrance. 5 minutes later, that nice scent has completely gone and some cheap perfume smell started bothering me. That's when I read the ingredients on the box and realized there listed a perfume.
Before I ordered, I did read the product description which I found totally misleading. When it said ""Pine Grove Scent (Concentration 0.5%)"", it sounded as if they were natural scent. Turned out that was not the case.
Even after multiple times of washing, the smell was still too strong and gave me a headache.
It was horrible and I would not recommend it to anyone."

Deeply moisturizes my hands while getting rid of the skin fissures and dryness due to winter weather and over washing.

It does have an overpowering musky scent that I really don't like and it lingers for a long time even after washing the hands multiple times. I've realized it's the strong scent of pine.

Now let's talk about the packaging. The pump does not have an arrow like a standard pump does showing which way to turn to open and close so you're left turning both ways hoping that the pump pops up. It took about 5 minutes of turning to finally figure out that you have to push in the middle of the pump to make it pop up! You'd think for the price that you pay for such a small bottle that they would at least add that to the pump."

I’m assuming this is the “earthy woodsy” scent, but it smells almost like baby powder to me and is kind of off-putting. It is very light and hydrating, very easy to spread on and lasts all day. If I saw this in a standalone shop and got the chance to smell it first, I’d give it a pass. Scents are very personal things though and this probably smells perfectly amazing for many others out there.

It has a silky-smooth texture and feels sufficiently nourishing without being sticky or greasy or taking too long to sink in. The scent is just divine. Personally, I’m very adverse to overly sweet scents and find them quite sickening. This moisturizer isn't very sweet and smells like a pine forest - I really can’t get enough of it. It’s one of the few free Vine products that I will order again at full price once I run out. It's expensive, but not more so than other high-end moisturizers.

Very fragrant floral pine scent. The cream is thick and comes in a pump bottle. It is moisturizing, but personally I'm not a huge fan of the pine scent. Fragrance wise it is so strong that it can double as perfume if you put some on your wrist or your neck area.

I had a hard time with the pump when I tried to loosen it. I turned it so many times and it wouldn't come up. Eventually I turned it while pulling up and it seemed to work. Don't ask me which way I turned it tho lol.

It is a nice and thick body cream that does moisturize the body, however, due to the extreme scent, it's not for me. But if you like the floral pine scent and don't mind the fragrance, I say try it out!"

I wanted to love this one because I really like other Joseon products, but after one use my eyes became swollen and I got hives on my face and neck. The next day my face was covered in white bumps and it was super raw and itchy.

I did a second test on my skin to see if it really was this product that was the problem. My face got super itchy and raw after about an hour.

I would not reccomend this to anyone with sensitive skin."

First right of the bat it improved the texture of my skin leaving it very soft.
I had no irritations which is great.
I tend to get these “allergic reaction pimples” and spent a lot of money on truly beauty for example just to have itchy pimple all over my forehead and other areas. This was the reason why I looked into something else, and more affordable too.
This fit the bill and worth a try.
And I am so glad I did.
No itchy pimples and after a week I can’t totally tell that it’s working.
I can see that my skin is brighter.
I never used this brand before and now u can’t wait to try other products."

As someone with combined skin tone, dealing with dark spots and pigmentation, incorporating this serum into my regime, I've noticed a significant improvement in fading those spots.

This is perfect for the novice to vitamin c skincare. Vitamin c is known for its collagen boosting and brightening properties. However, it can be irritating to skin. This product is wonderful for many reasons. First, the packaging is opaque and closed. Very important because vitamin c is very unstable, exposure to light and air can cause it to become inactive very quickly. If a vitamin c product has transparent packaging and/or the entire product is exposed upon opening, pass on it. Waste of your money. It will discolor and be unstable in no time and be pointless to apply. Second, the percentage of vitamin c is appropriate for beginners or sensitive skin. The type of vitamin c used in this product (ethyl ascorbic acid) is very stable as well. It is less likely to become inactive quickly and is gentle on skin. In contrast, L-ascorbic acid the pure form of vitamin c is more effective for results but is very unstable and can be harsh/irritating on sensitive skin. The centella that is also in this product is calming which is another bonus for sensitive type skin. The consistency is gel like and pumps out well from the packaging. I use two pumps after toner and before spf in the AM on my face and neck. Always use spf after applying your vitamin c skincare. This serum has no scent. Skincare is no place for fragrances! The product absorbs quickly and is not tacky. I apply a 30 spf after it is absorbed then my sheer foundation. The serum does well under foundation and does not feel tacky or cause a congested feel to my skin. Vitamin c takes several weeks to make noticeable changes to your skin. Give the ingredient time to work. Start low and slow with vitamin c. Low referring to the percentage and slow referring to the frequency it is introduced to your skin. I have used this product for four weeks and have seen some improvements to dark spots/acne scars as well as the brightness of my skin. I will probably venture to a product with a higher percentage of vitamin c after I finish this product, since my skin will then be accustomed to vitamin c.

Update: I used up this product in about three months, that is with two pumps in the AM. The packaging is wonderful in that I don’t feel like much (if any!) product is left over after the pump doesn’t dispense the serum anymore. I noticed an overall brightening and lightening of some dark spots during my three month use."

As a Korean with eczema, this duo really helps moisturize my extremely dry skin. It's just a cherry on top that it leaves you glowing afterwards. I'm lazy and do not re-apply throughout the day, but I've found that this will last you just fine if you apply once at night after your shower and facial cleanse. My routine for the past few weeks has been the following: double cleanse with Manyo cleansing oil and foam duo in the shower (like I said, I'm lazy so without getting my face wet, I rub with the oil for 30 sec, emulsify, then wash off. Then with my wet face I apply the foam and then rinse and complete the rest of my shower). Once I get out, I dry my face and have only been using this serum and moisturizer (probably should be using toner and whatnot but this has been fine for me. My skin has never been better).

It’s oil — Duh! If you’re acne prone, use it for double cleansing with something else that treats acne (salicylic acid or benzoyl perioxide face wash). Wash with oil first; rinse; then use acne wash. I made the mistake of not double cleansing the first time I used this and, of course, developed a pimple within the day. This product has coconut oil and I’ve always broken out if I leave raw coconut oil on my skin.

The smell, to me, is that of Tea Tree Oil but I don’t see any in the ingredients. I do agree that soybean oil is a cheap byproduct and that, if there’s a heavy scent in the product, that perhaps they are trying to hide a rancid oil smell.

Otherwise, I actually very much liked this product prior to reading the nasty reviews!"

Since writing my first review, I have discovered just how beautiful this cleansing oil really is. I wipe my face with warm water on a makeup wash cloth, put a couple of pumps of the oil in my hand, and just drip a few drops of warm water onto the oil in my hand, and immediately, it starts to turn like...creamy and white - not a frothy foam, but like milk in my hands. Then, I massage the creamy oil into my skin, and it doesn't really lather, so much as it seems to just become no longer oily. When I wipe it away, it leaves my skin just so...CLEAN and soft, but not feeling like it has stripped my face of all moisture like my benzoyl peroxide face wash does. It's bouncy and dewy and smooth. The other up side is that I don't have to wash my under eye areas separately with a gentle cleanser (I was using baby shampoo before buying this cleanser, and washing it first so that I didn't get benzoyl peroxide into my delicate under eye areas, which would have dried it out and caused worse fine lines). I can use this oil to gently wash my under eye area with my finger tips and to wash off my eye makeup if I'm wearing any, because it is so gentle and it adds moisture, instead of taking it away. My skin hasn't looked this good in decades - if EVER! I'm 41, and my skin looks better than it did at 31...or 21 for that matter, because for the first time in I can't remember when, I have ZERO blemishes, and - TMI, but: I'm in that point in my cycle when I'm usually having the worst breakouts, but not a single pimple or blackhead or bump of any kind. NOTHING has done so much for my skin as this oil has. Not retinol, not salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide not an expensive cream or serum - nothing!

I used to DREAD washing my face, because I had to take care not to get any under my eyes or on my neck, and had to thoroughly get all of it off when rinsing, etc, but this cleansing oil has turned my least favorite part of my skin care routine into my FAVORITE part! And I no longer dislike the smell; I now associate it with the lovely experience. I WILL be reordering! I'm even contemplating buying one to use in the shower! Seriously.

If you are interested in trying an oil-based face wash, but you're an oily or combination skin type, THIS is the one to try! It's now ESSENTIAL to my skin care routine. Did I say I LOVE it?!

Original review: So, first of all, I'm VERY impressed with the shipping. I ordered it after 11am, and it was on my porch by 4. Having two toddlers and no time to leave the house, that is just VERY convenient.

On to its quality: it feels very light and left my skin feeling clean and soft, and did not make me greasy. I did enjoy the spa-like feeling, too. It wiped clean with just warm water and a microfiber towel that's made for makeup removal.

However, my biggest issue is with the smell. It stinks. BUT, as a girl who grew up on the border of Appalachia and the Midwest, I recognize that smell: it's ginseng. While I don't usually desire scents in my skin care products, I would probably have approved of some modification of the smell of this particular product. That said, I'm going to continue using it BECAUSE of the ginseng and its antioxidant properties...but I'll probably follow it up with a toner that DOESN'T stink. lol

I'm an oily skin girl, and so far I don't think it's going to make things worse - especially since I'm still in the 6-8 week retinol purge, so not much CAN make it worse...ugh! AND my skin probably needs the addition of oil to prevent any dryness retinol may cause later on down the road.

I'm going to use this product up, and I'll decide when it gets close to empty whether or not I'm going to reorder. So far, so good. Excellent price for what you get too, so if you're looking for an effective oil cleanser that isn't just canola or coconut oil that will leave you greasy, this is the one.

Time will tell, and I'll be back - good or bad."

I was attempting to use this oil cleanser because I’ve heard great things about the brand and have used the rice honey face mask with no issues. This product seemed to work okay after the first use and i thought i genuinely started to see a difference by the second time. By the third time i noticed my face to have a texture that felt dry/grainy and i thought it could be my skin going through the purging process before looking like glass skin, but it has left me with pustules and painful red bumps. Its been a week of not using it and my skin has not been recovering well."

Pros: it works well as a gentle cleanser and does not dry out/strip your skin (as you would expect with a cleansing oil).
Affordable and lasts a very long time.

Cons: I mainly bought it to do the heavy lifting with removing my makeup and it did not do such a great job. I had to either cleanse with this oil twice to remove majority of the makeup followed by a different cleanser or micellar water or use more of the micellar water if using it once. Also if you use it heavily on your eyes, it would sting. For reference, I don’t use a lot of make up just tinted moisturizer, mascara and blush/bronzer.
It does have an added fragrance, but it does have a scent (maybe the natural scent of the ginseng oil) that kind of reminded me of gasoline, which I really disliked.

Personally for me, I won’t be purchasing it again."

I adore the smell of real rice wine, and it feels so authentically Korean especially in the packaging, as does BOJ's brand itself. The rice wine smell is very natural smelling, and reminds me of when fermented rice water for hair and your face was super viral on youtube, pinterest, etc. a few years ago, which I really like and appreciate. This is what sets it apart from the other rice toners imo, that it's made of fermented rice.

The advertising campaign with the rice mask has been on point, and totally convinced me to try the two lol. As for the performance, it leaves a finish that is matte (maybe tacky?) to the touch, but leaves a subtle glow on my cheeks, which makes sense, as rice and kaolin clay absorb oil. When I soak a cotton pad and leave it on my face for 30 minutes it provides nice hydration and is comparable to using real rice wine as a sheet mask.

Overall: This would definitely be able to do what it's supposed to on oilier skin than mine, but I have really enjoyed it nevertheless. It's not magic, but I think this is a really unique product, and I will repurchase as I absolutely love the sophisticated scent :)"

It's not bad but for 19 dollars I just don't see myself purchasing this again. Aluminum Chlorohydrate is an aluminum salt and it is an ingredient in the toner that is used to close the pores but it can be toxic to your skin which is probably why this toner isn't very moisturizing. I felt that the rice had a nice cooling effect on my face and I really wanted to like this toner, mainly because it was expensive but because beauty of joseon usually uses gentle, non toxic ingredients.

After using it sporadically for a few months, I've come to the conclusion it wasn't for me.

I have dry, combination skin, which can get oily during summertime, but still ends up drying if I don't apply adequate moisture. I was hoping this product would help remedy that issue: delivering moisture and hydration while also controlling oil. Unfortunately, my skin ended up drying out often after applying this product, and a few times it felt like it was irritating my skin, especially around the nose area. I do like the mattifying effect it initially gave me, but the feeling of dryness was a tad bit overwhelming.

As usual, the packaging is minimalistic and attractive, and I do believe the ingredients are of good quality, but unfortunately it just did not work out for me. Overall, I give this product a 3 out of 5. I would not repurchase for myself, but for my oily skin girlies? Perhaps this might work for you."

I have oily-combination skin, and finding a toner that balances my skin without making it feel greasy has always been a struggle. This toner, though, has been a game-changer.

The first thing I noticed was how light and refreshing it feels. It's not heavy or sticky like some toners, which is a huge plus for me. After using it consistently, I can genuinely see a difference in how balanced my skin looks. My T-zone isn’t as oily by midday, and my skin feels softer, more hydrated, but never greasy.

What I love the most is the fact that it contains rice extract, which adds a subtle glow without clogging my pores or feeling too rich. It feels like my skin is being nourished, not suffocated. And the fact that it’s a Korean skincare product just makes it even better because I’ve always had great experiences with K-beauty products. They just seem to get how to cater to different skin types.

If you have oily or combination skin and you’re looking for something that will keep your skin balanced while still giving you that healthy glow, I can’t recommend this toner enough. It’s honestly been a lifesaver for my skin, and I can see myself using this for a long time. It feels like one of those rare products that really deliver on what they promise!"

I’d put this as a mild toner – you can feel that it’s doing something, while not as useless as some I’ve tried, it’s not as overly moisturizing as some others I’ve tried – this is somewhere in the middle.

Like any other rice toner, you have to shake the bottle well before use. The toner is an off-white color, which is a little different when compared to the ""I'm from Rice milky toner"" which is a true white. This was an added bonus since I felt like this color is more true to rice water, which means less processing/additives added to make the product a brighter white color.

The rice toner scent did not have any added scent/fragrance (that I could tell), so it smelled like rice water. I've been using it for 3 days now and it works like a charm. The only thing that could be improved is the gritty feeling I get on my skin after applying the product. Not sure if this is residual rice remnants, but it's not so noticeable that I would stop using it."

I have pretty good skin overall, especially for an old lady of 54, but there a few areas I’d like to diminish (mainly my waistline but, sadly, this isn’t the right product for that!).

This product separates so I give it a good shake first; I’ve been using this with a cotton ball and a little goes a long way - I used way too much product the first time. A few drops is really all I need - and you can always use more if needed. I haven’t noticed any fragrance and my skin feels soft and moist after using, the perfect canvas for whatever serums I choose to use next.

It’s hard to speak to the effectiveness because if it’s something you're already using it’s hard to notice a difference if the product is comparable. However, if it’s something new, it usually takes a while for any real benefits to show up. I haven’t noticed any issues or changes yet but, if that changes over time, I’ll update my review accordingly.

The first time I used this mask, it was lovely - a very mild honey smell, left my skin feeling very soft afterwards. A few weeks later, I applied this mask and was shocked when my skin felt like it was burning within 1 minute. And I don’t mean a tingly or stinging sensation, it literally felt like my face was on fire. It was so painful that I had to wash the mask off right away. Clearly my skin reacted to something in this mask... I do still love BoJ’s rice water serum and I also use the red bean face wash and the red bean mask."

Its blend of ground rice and honey provides gentle exfoliation while deeply nourishing the skin, leaving it soft, radiant, and hydrated. The mask is lightweight and non-irritating, making it suitable for even the most sensitive skin types.

The 150ml size offers great value for regular use, and its natural ingredients align with the brand's commitment to traditional Korean skincare methods. While it’s an excellent product, the thick texture might take some effort to rinse off completely. Despite this minor inconvenience, it’s a luxurious and effective mask that deserves a glowing 5-star rating!"

I have to be very careful about products that I put on my face because my skin is very sensitive and I have eczema so I am allergic to a lot of stuff and I can't always tell when it will happen. Also my skin is very, very dry (I use queen Helene cocoa butter in the tub as face lotion) because of my eczema so anything that strips skin even a little bit or damages moisture barrier is a huge no. It's gotta be very gentle. I was really satisfied with this product! I feel like it helped give me that ""lit from within"" glowy look. My skin actually doesn't feel irritated. One reason I wanted to switch to a tub was to limit the environmental damage from sheet masks.

One thing that I was concerned about was I have done masks like this before and they dry hard and unpleasant feeling, but this one wasn't like that at all. After about the 20 or so minutes, it was still the same texture, still wet and not uncomfortable at all. Like others have said, it does smell like baby food, I would say almost like banana oatmeal baby food, but it's not unpleasant.

I feel like it's a good value for money and will go a long way. Included with it was a little spoon for applying and a spoonful was maybe around a dime size maybe. I think I used 4 of them to do a layer. I'm confident that, using this mask 2-3 times a week, it will last quite a while.

I really liked it, it felt refreshing, seemed to do my skin good and seems like a good value, so I would recommend it!"

Due to quick results I really think it’s a good value. I didn’t notice any really glowy affects , just pore shrinking which honestly is better! I didn’t notice any stickiness despite honey being an ingredient , cooling and feels nice to apply. I really like it so far!

I am increasing the rating to 5 stars because of its magical ability in solving breakouts (which I did not expect whatsoever). Sure it mentioned this mask could calm down inflammation but what I didn’t know was when a recent angry pimple surfaced up with white pus smack dab on my forehead - I hesitantly gave this mask a shot. Unbeknownst to me, it immediately removed the redness post-mask and I kid you not - in a day or so, the pus was gone and so was the pimple altogether. It was as if nothing has occurred. I am beyond blown away by this unassuming miracle worker and all this time I’ve been utilizing a Neutrogena spot acne gel when I could be using this mask instead. And it could instantly brighten your skin to a radiant glow while combatting pimples?? Sign me up. I’ll forever purchase this product. Beauty of Joseon, you’ve outdone yourself. 👏👏

Original: I’m glad to have encountered Beauty of Joseon’s products on Amazon, otherwise I would not have known about this mask as well as their other products. I owned this ground rice/honey mask and also their red bean pore version. Since this is a new purchase, I’ve only used it a couple of times at the moment. The mask smelled like homemade oatmeal and I find it soothing and comforting. While I can’t say this has helped my blackheads and pores after a few usage, what I can say was the instant glowing effect was blatantly obvious. If that’s what you’re looking for to brighten up dull skin, this is a mask for you. My face is naturally soft to the touch, so I can’t say it’s made it more soft. I purchased this in hopes it’ll help with the appearance of shrinking pores and most of all - lessening of my blackheads. I suppose it’s a tall order since I haven’t found a viable solution yet - not even after all these years, but one can remain hopeful, right?"

This American formula is just not the same. It’s MUCH thicker, it’s doesn’t have that moisturizing feeling. It makes my face feel very greasy after wards. It has that sunscreen smell to it, which the Korean version does not. AND it’s 10 less spf than the Korean version. I was very disappointed when this came in because I didn’t realize the formula available in the us had changed"

I obviously loved the first one and was skeptical when what I squeezed out was slightly thicker and smelled a bit more like sunscreen. It’s feels more moisturizing, but not in any way sticky and leaves no white cast. Once dry it feels exactly the same as the original, and I can do my usual routine after without any visible difference. I don’t use any foundation though, just JR Miracle Balm for my dry skin. While I don’t necessarily think that it’s okay to just spring something else on people I’m not too upset because I like this version too."

The sunscreen scent is very mild. It's great for my sensitive skin and absorbs very quickly. It is not thick or heavy and leaves your skin with a nice healthy glow."

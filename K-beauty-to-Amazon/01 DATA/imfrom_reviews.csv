I've used this face mask for 3 Months and fell in love with it. I have acne prone skin. Every time I've used this mask my face it was left less irritated and hydrated, I also love how easy it is to wipe off. Needless to say, this mask has become a part of my monthly facial routine."

It's a good sign it is naturally scented and good for sensitive skin. Really helps plump the skin and make the pores look much smaller and helps with the tone and eveness. Have a very strong feeling I will buy again.
Had to drop a star because it often separates and you have to mix the jar as well as the smell."

it's very sticky, which is to be expected with a honey face mask; but i just didn't feel like my skin felt very soothed after having it on. it kind of reminds me of a sheet mask, but at least sheet masks leave you feeling moisturized-since you have to really go at your skin to get it off with how sticky it is, i didn't really feel like i got any positive benefits out of it. i'll use the rest of it since it was pricey, but i wouldn't buy it again."

My first suggestion is to get a subscription, my next is really stir it up good when you first get it!

This mask goes on nice an d smooth and it comes with an applicator/stirrer that is reusable, so don’t pitch it!

Remember everyone's skin is different and what works for me might not work for you.

But this product was so moisturizing and gentle on my sensitive skin. It's nice to have the added boost of moisture during the winter months.

One of the things I particularly liked was that I could leave it on my skin for a long period of time without it feeling like the mask was taking moisture from my skin as it dried.

It's made of honey, and smells like it too. But the texture is smooth and not sticky, but do keep in mind that separation can occur during shipment so give the mask a good stir to blend the ingredients all back together before use.

I've only used it once so I can't speak for long term effects, but it was wonderful the first use. But I wouldn't be surprised if the moisturizing benefits are less noticeable once my skin becomes more acclimated to the ingredients."

After a few stirs, it looks like dulce de leche and smells like honey toffee. It's super sticky as to be expected, but creamy too, and applies easily with a silicone spatula (the included plastic spatula would be better for a firmer product, IMO). I only wore it for about ten minutes but my skin felt soft and hydrated after. I tend to steer clear of masks because of the mess factor, and this one definitely isn't tidy, but it smells delicious and makes my skin feel nice, so I'll make an exception for this one."

- The scent is like raw honey, which I find quite pleasant.
- The mask was initially separated in the jar, and a quick mix restored its creamy consistency that has been maintained.
- I’ve used it about twice a week so far, and that’s like 8 applications.
- Application: A thin layer on the face and neck, left on for about 40-50 minutes.
- Result: After rinsing off, my skin is softer and calmer. I do need to moisturize afterward or my face feels a bit tight. While I haven’t noticed a glow or increased hydration, I’ve also not experienced any sensitivity from using this mask, which is great. (My normal skin is quite sensitive and reactive, and I reviewed the ingredient list before buying.)
- Verdict: A decent mask for both pre-party or after-party, to prep the skin or calm it down respectively. I like to use it if my skin is particularly irritated from heat and sweat."

First off, it’s amazing! I’ve been using the famous Water Cream for years. But at $72 a pop it was really getting tough. If you’re looking for something similar but better, this is it! I have oily and combo skin (depending on the day) and this helps 100%. It has hyaluronic acid in it, which is what I was looking for. It’s scentless and colorless, and from my testing it doesn’t clog my pores either! Has a very lasting moisturizing feel without being sticky, greasy, or oily. Will 100% repurchase.

The only moisturizer that I used was the Curology moisturizer, but it isn't enough to protect and to moisturize my skin. Also, due to the nature of my sensitive combo skin (dry cheeks and oily everywhere else), it was really hard for me to find a moisturizer that didn't irritate my skin. Then I became desperate and went through my collection of Korean skincare complementary samples, and one of them is the I'm From Vitamin Tree Water-gel, along with a few others, that I really enjoy using on my skin.

For the longest time, I didn't care for moisturizers but after 2 nights of using the gel and gel-cream, my skin looks healthy and youthful again. The gel-cream glides easily on the skin without much force. The consistency is more of a hybrid of gel + cream, meaning that it's lightweight but not watery like other gel moisturizers. It's also not heavy and thick but it can hold the shape very well if you take some with your fingertip. My skin absorbs it easily, and I didn't suffer from any sticky residue. It definitely adds another layer of hydration when I use the Curology medicated cream."

They should put it in a clear square airless pump bottle with a frosted base, a matte neck and a gloss black top."

It's okay to use with acne prone skin and in my opinion helped clear my skin and even out my skin tone. I did find that if I used it with any other moisturizing products that this product became too heavy for my skin and I got oily. So because of that, I use this alone in the day time. Toner underneath is okay but if your skin is not super dry this will be over moisturizing if you use with other moisturizing products.

The scent is strong and unappealingly floral and 'powdery'. It is also possible to detect a slight scent of ginseng, which combines in an offensive way with the powdery, floral scent. I'd heard that it used to just smell like ginseng, and I wish it still did.
It doesn't seem to be a fake product, as I recently read that because it is marketed to older women, it supposedly smells this way (now) to appeal to those consumers. If true, it's a failure of a marketing idea. I guess I would be considered ""older"", and, based on the scent alone, I will never purchase this product again. I wish I could return it."

It is a no-frills essence that is just 3 ingredients: water, mugwort and a preservative, that’s it. I think that is why it is something that I can tolerate when my skin is so angry and inflamed. I use it every day now, even when my skin is calm and not irritated.

It is a watery consistency that absorbs very quickly into the skin and feels very cooling and moisturizing on contact. For me, it is a great beginning step right after I cleanse that calms my skin and preps it for my serum and moisturizer. For the days when my skin is extra angry, I will put this on periodically through the day. I almost wish it came in a misting bottle for this purpose!

This bottle will last you quite a while which makes is a great value for your money as well. I have used it at least once (usually two or three times) a day for the last month and I am not even a third of the way through it.

The packaging overall is very nice. I love the weight and feel of the glass bottle (it makes me feel kinda bougie) but just be careful to keep it away from the edge of the sink as it will break if it drops!

Overall, this has become a mainstay in my skincare routine and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has sensitive and/or irritated skin."

There is no stinging and the skin soaks it up without any lingering tackiness.

I tried the travel/sample size --- love that more affordable option since shops via amazon mostly do not allow returns after trying as far as I know --- and really liked it. I am hoping this will help with my rosacea but haven't used it long enough nor exclusively to really know. That said, I enjoy it enough to continue with a the full sized bottle and give it a try.

Firstly, the product is excessively watery, a far cry from the original version. Despite being marketed for sensitive skin, it caused unexpected breakouts and bumps on my face. I diligently followed the usage instructions, but this turned out to be a regrettable purchase.

The moisturizer cream from the same company shares a similar fate—thin, watery, and messy, offering no justice to my skin. The original, with its thicker texture, was much better. I implore the company to reconsider returning to the thicker essence that truly absorbed into the skin.

This watered-down version not only failed to deliver results but also led to skin issues. If you have sensitive skin, I strongly advise against trusting this product; it's not a wise investment. Returning it was a hassle, and the entire experience was a waste of time and money.

I typically don't write negative reviews, but this product left me profoundly disappointed. As someone who enjoyed great skin previously, I wanted to enhance it further, but this turned out to be a setback. For now, I'm sticking to good old-fashioned cocoa butter for reliable hydration. Save your money and steer clear of this thin, drippy, watery disappointment. 🚫 #BuyerBeware #SkinCareDisappointment"

I've been going no makeup a lot this summer and noticed that I've been experiencing more redness from the heat and wanted that mugwort goodness, which helps calm and cool my skin a lot. I previously gravitated towards Missha over I'm From because it was a better price point, but I guess since it's undergoing a renewal, I couldn't find it anywhere, so I decided to buy the I'm From essense instead. Using this made me realize how well my skin does with this type of formulation and I shouldn't stray away from a great thing because I was ""bored"". This essence has a watery consistency, but when it's applied on the face, it has almost a slippery (not slimey) feel to it where it doesn't dissipate as quickly as watery toners. I have oily skin and it doesn't feel too heavy on my skin, it it layers well under makeup, and the redness has definitely subsided a lot since using this. I'll have to keep using it to see if I prefer this or the Missha one more, but at this time, I can't say that I notice a big difference."

This little bottle of Korean skincare magic has been a game-changer for my sensitive skin.

The star of the show here is mugwort extract, which is 100% vegan and PETA-approved (love that for us). It’s incredibly soothing, and after just a few uses, my skin felt less irritated, calmer, and more balanced. If you’ve got redness or sensitivity, this essence works like a gentle hug for your face.

The texture is lightweight, almost watery, so it absorbs quickly without feeling sticky or heavy—perfect as the first step after cleansing. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated, making it an easy addition to any routine, no matter your skin type.

Bonus points for how versatile it is. You can use it to prep your skin before serums, layer it for extra hydration, or even soak a cotton pad and use it like a quick DIY calming mask. It’s one of those products that makes you feel like you’ve got your skincare life together.

If you’re looking for a toner that’s gentle but effective, with clean ingredients and zero fuss, this essence is a must-try. It’s proof that skincare doesn’t have to be complicated to make a difference. Calm skin, here we come!"

My husband gifted me a bottle of SK ll. I did see an improvement in my skin but I didn’t think it was $200 plus for the changes in my skin. I could duplicate some of the radiance and clarity I saw in my skin tone with more affordable, but quality skin care from Korean and Japanese brands.

On the positive side, I'll keep using it until it's totally gone, which will take a while, because a little goes a long way and the bottle works nicely to use as a reservoir to refill a spritzer bottle. I'm just sad it wasn't a noticeable improvement product for me!"

Mine was missing the spatula, but luckily I had another on hand. The pricetag seemed a little high for an impulse buy, but it only takes about an almond-sized amount to put a thin layer on my whole face, so I imagine it will last a while.

It goes on cool and jelly like and doesn't totally dry down, but does get a little thick so it's slightly difficult to wash off with just hands and water; I'll probably try it before a shower next time. It has a refreshing, distinctly herbal scent and it's instantly soothing on the skin. I didn't even realize my skin felt irritated beforehand, but afterward it felt...less irritated, somehow. It calmed my mild redness and had a very gentle exfoliating effect, leaving my skin feeling extra clean but still hydrated. Plus, it fits my natural bog witch aesthetic."

The skin feels hydrated and plump right after! Love the earthy smell, it also has a cooling effect so I imagine it would be very pleasant in summer. It also has a very calming effect on redness and inflamation - 20 minutes on my face is enough to see results.

Granted, I overhauled my skin care but my blackheads didn't go away until I put this on.

Now with that said, a couple things to note:
The directions say to keep it on 5-10 mins which I think is good. My face was starting to warm up a bit and went a little numb but definitely made me think it was firming me up. On the other hand I gotta be honest, if you can stand to keep this on your face longer than that I have mad respect for you cause THE SMELL IS AWFUL! Like, puke inducing. I was not prepared for that assult on my olfactory sense. My goodness, there was a second where I seriously contemplated snorting perfume to get the smell out of nose. Then I came to my senses and used Vicks around the rim of my nose. It's been about 45 mins and my stomach is still rolling. Which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I mean, why has nobody mentioned this?! It's my 1st experience with mugwort but hot d@mn that is awful. Ugh.

Conclusion: beauty is pain and sometimes you're gonna get assaulted (by terrible smells anyway, not people. Dont assult people. That would be bad). The good outweighs the bad, though. If that changes, I'll update my review (though I'm hoping it wont and maybe I'll get used to the stink...or buy a nose plug like kids at the pool wear.) Hope this helps!"

when my skin is irritated and breaking out, it really seems to help cool, calm, and soothe my skin just after using the mask for 15-20mins.
Now the negatives:
It's pricey and somewhat difficult to spread evenly over my face. I've used a spatula, brush and my hands and everytime it is difficult. Also, this mask makes a pretty big mess. It will get stuck in your hairline and will stick to your sink when rinsing.

I think the positive outweighs the negatives, but as usual, ymmv. Overall once I am out of this, I will not repurchase. I will recommend the essence 100x over this mask."

I had an allergic reaction to Farmacy's Green Screen sunscreen which left me with about 30-50 small bumps and whiteheads across my forehead in particular. I was also experiencing redness from the acne/allergic reaction, so I purchased the mugwort hoping it would help. It did!

When the package arrived, there was a small plastic spatula in the box next to the jar of product. There were some green spots on the white applicator and on the interior of the box itself, making me wonder if it had been previously opened. I'm still unsure about that, but I haven't had any problems with the mugwort.

It has a goopy gel base and then basically small twigs and debris thrown in as well. It's not what you would call an Instagram worthy mask, if that's your thing. However, I did feel it soothing my skin as soon as it was applied (to clean, dry skin), and it felt good for the duration (10 minutes) of its application to my face. It was easy to rinse off, and I noticed perhaps a 40% reduction in redness after use.

I used it two days in a row, and it seemed to help clear up some of the disaster left by the Farmacy product. Would recommend if you're just looking for a soothing, moisturizing product."

I’ve seen people saying they can’t the tolerate the smell, but the smell is in my opinion do-able it isn’t as extreme as people have been saying. it smells very.. tree like? nature like? it says to keep it applied for 5-10 minutes but i like to max that out. after use, my skin feels so SMOOTH! and i also feel like redness has gone down, as i get red quickly. as for acne, it helps my skin but it hasnt been a lifesaver as i’ve used it a few times. i have oily/combo skin and i’m acne prone. if you don’t have a routine yet, i would instead go spend money on cleansers, moisturisers etc. and figure out what type skin you have, really saves money if you know.

this mask is nice but it’s more an extra item for better skin, i have only been using it at the start for every day (bc i wanted fast results) but i’m lessening that to once or twice a week so it’s really a routine!

i also wanna give out tips, first it’s important to go buy sometjing that keeps your hair out of your face when you go to sleep and frequently change your pillow case, as your face can get oily/bacteria from that."

When you apply it on your face, you will see some coarse particles in it. After applying it on your face for 5 minutes, it does not to dry out at all. Instead, you can push out the dead skin by gently rubbing it in circles with your fingers. During the process, the skin feels moisturized, without any artificial fragrance, and has a light rice fragrance. My skin is not oily but a little dry, and I have sensitive skin. After washing the mask, I found that my cheeks were a little allergy, but it disappeared after 10 minutes, so my personal advice is to apply a thin layer first to try it out. I will continue to update after using it next time to see if there are still any allergies."

I have tried other Korean products and this is one of those that I’ve had great results with.

I only use 4 products on my skincare after my showers/washes. This is the first one I apply and it’ll remove the extra dirt that the cleanser missed. Sometimes I apply it with my hands as is, other times I use a cotton pad and wipe my face. Then, I apply rose water spray + hyaluronic acid on top and everything mixes well together. I’ve never experienced an allergic or skin reaction to mixing it with other skincare products.

I have noticed that whenever I stop using this product, I do break out more often. I think the big bottle is worth the value for the money but the travel size one is way too small.

Overall, I am a happy customer and will continue using! A bottle typically lasts me 1-2 months and I use it 2x per day every day!"

It gives a healthy glow and hydration! It felt nice on my skin from the first use and I have dry skin especially during winter, I get a lot of dry skin flares around my mouth area. It helped with the flares and kept my skin hydrated.

I alternate my skincare routine on a daily basis, I don’t use the same steps AM & PM every single day.
I sometimes use it PM and not AM and other times the other way around. I see what my skin needs and I do it. If I want an extra boost of hydration I apply it after cleansing on clean dry skin.

I have oily combination skin and had to issues with this toner. I absolutely recommend it! I finished 2 bottles of it and will definitely get more."

Its thin and watery consistency not only failed to live up to the original but also caused unexpected breakouts and bumps on my supposedly sensitive skin.

Much like the Mugwort Essence, the moisturizer's poor quality became evident—dripping and lacking the effectiveness of its thicker predecessor. The thin, watery formula does no justice to the skin, leaving me wishing for the return of the original's superior texture.

Regrettably, this product doesn't hold up to its promises, and if you have sensitive skin, consider this a cautionary tale. The return process was a hassle, and the entire experience felt like a waste of time and money.

While negative reviews aren't my usual approach, this product left me with no choice. For reliable hydration, I'll be sticking to tried-and-true solutions like good old-fashioned cocoa butter. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this thin, drippy Mugwort Moisturizer. 🚫 #BuyerBeware #SkinCareFail"

It tends to work best in my nighttime routine towards the end of it when I'm layering moisturizers (in my mid 50s so I'm hitting my skin hard to keep it hydrated and supple). This cream is one of the last things to go on my skin before the occlusive moisturizer. What do I love about it? It's calming and soothing as I apply it. I keep it in my skincare frig so it feels even BETTER when going on nice and cold. Especially for summer. Mugwort is a K-beauty staple renowned for its soothing properties and I've noticed it seems to help with my rosacea-prone skin. Also, the scent of this cream is deeply earthy and extremely calming to me. I'm keeping this in the rotation even through winter. As a lighter-textured cream, this works best in a layering routine for people with mature or dry skin. Oily skin would probably do well with this as a stand alone.

Love it! Might try their licorice cream next."

I was amazed at how powerful it was it turned out to be the best defense for me against the ""contaminated"" air and water that literally destroyed my home, killed my innocent animal's & devastated my entire life. I was using essential oils to help protect my skin/hair and my animal's skin/hair. Mold/Fungal spores are alive and travel in the air and attach to our clothing, hair & skin.

Even a simple vitamin C serum causes breakouts, the niacinamide of The Ordinary also causes redness and breakouts, face masks also causes acnes and irritations. I always have to be very careful with what I feed to my skin. Thankfully, this is a really effective moisturiser. It soothes in my skin and every time I apply it to the areas where I have redness or active acnes, I always see improvements in just overnight.

I’ve had bad luck with moisturizers stinging my face, and/or pilling after application. This makes my skin feel perfectly hydrated, without any stinging, and my acne has significantly improved after a week of use. In the AM I layer it over my vitamin c serum, and coenzyme Q10, then apply my spf. At night it goes over my matrixyl synthe 6, then AHA, and I have not had any issues with pilling.

The use of fig intrigued me and I was really excited to try it. I have previously had really awful acne after having kids and doc kept saying it'll go away after my hormones regulate but it never did. Got a facial and esthetician recommended trying products to add moisture instead of the drying acne products I was using. I did a bunch of research and bought my first cleansing balm to pair with a gel cleanser and a few other products. Within two months my skin was clear, not perfect but finally clear. I used this product after running out of my second refill of the other cleanser and I was immediately kind of disappointed. The smell is nice but is quite strong and lingers on the face even after a second wash, essence, toner, and moisturizer. The product also did not melt very well. There was a rather hard layer on top which transitioned into a soft creamy texture closer to the bottom of the container rather than a uniform consistency that melts. I was left with very stubborn chunks that required a lot of pressure and friction to break down. Not exactly ideal. Ended up just digging under the weird top layer to get to the softer area. I did use the entire container but my skin has started breaking out again and I didn't feel as clean as I did after using the mandarin orange balm I had been using before. I've gone back to the orange and my skin is already starting to feel better. If you have acne prone skin maybe try something else first."

After use my skin glowed for days and received questions as to what had I done to my face... people thought I had a professional peal.
I highly recommend if you are looking for a way to deal with dry skin and have glowing skin.
I struggle with dry skin from exfoliating 3X a week, so I looked for a product to use in between exfoliating.
Since this, I only exfoliate 1X a month.
Add the fig toner, the two together will leave you glowing!"

I would recommend."

I LOVE THIS. It only takes a small amount to clean off all of your makeup, including mascara. It comes with a small plastic scoop and I found that 1/2 the scoop will clean my entire face. I gently massage into to my skin and then rinse with warm water. Everything just melts off. I follow that up with a microfiber towel to remove any stubborn makeup like waterproof mascara. If I am not wearing any makeup, I let the residue remain after a quick rinse. The texture is very appealing. It is somewhere between a gel and a cream. It glides on like magic. It does have a light fragrance but nothing that irritates my sensitive, dry skin.

My two favorites are both OG K-Beauty Holy Grail products - BanilaCo Clean It Zero and Heimish All Clean. Both go on thick and a bit greasy, handily dissolve even the toughest waterproof eye makeup, emulsify easily and rinse clean. Honestly, I didn't think there would ever be another brand that could challenge my love for these two.

But this I'm from Fig Cleansing Balm is...well, the BOMB. It does everything that BanilaCo and Heimish do, plus it has the amazing [but mild] fragrance of figs. I love using this stuff. It feels so luxurious, yet is so lightweight. It has a load of natural plant extracts, including fig (naturally), moringa seed oil and turmeric. Of course, if you're avoiding artificial fragrance in your skincare, I'm obligated to mention there's that as well."

It has a mild earthy, fig like scent. You leave it on for 15 minutes and then wash it off. My face really reddened afterwards which was mostly gone in the morning.

The change to the texture of my skin was pretty dramatic. My skin was so smooth afterwards, even areas with uneven texture that had resisted other masks. It felt a little like I was sand blasted. My skin is a bit too fragile to use this very often but as a once in a while tune up? It really works.

Plan on showering it off....I spent a whole lot of time at the sink trying to rinse it off and it’s still in my hair line."

With consistent use, a relatively clean diet and proper skin hygiene, I've found this to be as good (if not a bit better considering the price) as Estee Lauder's night repair serum.

On nights when my skin is particularly troubled, I find pairing this with a little of the ginseng serum and mushroom collagen cream from the same brand does wonders, *especially* as a mask! I love to pair these with the youth to the people's dream cream (eyes) for my hereditary dark under-eye circles. When I do, my skin is almost fully recovered in the morning!"

I wanted to try something new, so I tried this out and I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, I only used if for 2 days before I noticed that it was making my skin super dry and itchy. I immediately stopped using it, but it did make my skin kind of flaky on one cheek and under my eye on the other side of my face. It didn't burn me like some other products have so I would say that's a win? Anyways, I went back to my normal skincare routine and my skin was back to normal in about a few days. Needless to say, I won't be trying any new products for a while."

I use tretinoin cream on my face 3-4X weekly and was looking for a cream that would pair well with it. For a while I had been using olive oil or avocado butter at night for dryness. Some of the dryness was from turning 40, working in a hospital and also from old pitted acne scars that just look awful with dry skin.
I wish I had bought this sooner l, as it sat in my Amazon cart for literally MONTHS!
My skin feels like I have glass skin. It goes on smooth and doesn’t leave me greasy, but also doesn’t absorb to the point I can’t tell if I put it on already. 10/10🙌
The first time I used it I was told my skin looks great! If you are on the fence like I was, please just buy it and see for yourself. I just saw they have a face wash/toner combo and I am buying that TODAY. I hope this company stays in business forever bc they are doing the Lord’s work in skin care."

I have tried almost every hyped and expensive product you can think of!! I am also very sensitive and acne prone….No moisturizer compares to this one! This melts beautifully into the skin! I read some reviews that this felt heavy. I highly disagree as I have extremely oily skin and most cream moisturizers feel like a mask. I usually buy gel creams or gel moisturizers for my day to day and use my creams at night. This is great for both day and night!! Now that the weather is getting cooler it’s causing my oily skin to overcompensate for the moisture it’s missing during the day but with this cream my skin feels comfortable and my makeup sits beautifully on top of this!! I am so happy and excited I found this!"

It takes awhile from that website so I was so happy to see amazon carries it and the shipping is fast. I've been using this cream now for about two years and I absolutely love it. I have combination skin and this is a perfect balance for my skin. It's super moisturizing but doesn't clog my pores. It also sits so well under my makeup and also at night time after I apply the rest of my skincare. I do have sensitive skin as well and this works great on my skin - especially around my eye area which is even more sensitive. I highly recommend if you have sensitive combination skin and have trouble finding a good cream that really moisturizes and doesn't clog pores. It really does help with balancing your oil / t-zone."

I’m not big on having a big routine, but I do what I must to take care of my skin and I will say that this has done great. My skin on my face used to produce excess oils because of my lack of moisturzing, but after moisturizing for a few weeks now with this, I feel that this product has helped soothe those issues and even soothe some acne. Soothe, not cure. Makes your skin soft and have a glow, but above all it does hydrate. It’s a bit pricy, but I was told that rice-based products are premium and on top of that, it’s a South Korean brand. Take that with a grain of salt though. Additionally, I like that the cream is absorbed quickly and leaves no lightening on your skin, although that depends on how much you put on. It’s completely odorless, which for me is a plus. I feel like it’s a small amount though for the big tag."

I got the tret burn and peeling. My other moisturizer sits more on the top of my skin and doesn't have ceramides. Within 2/3 days of using the product my redness, burning and peeling is gone. It absorbs into the skin nicely for me and is not fragranced from what I can tell. I also added in Pyunkang Yul black tea toner and my skin feels 10x better than it did.

It really felt good on my skin and it felt my skin was improving and suddenly I was hit with the most awful rash. Had to go to the doctor and was prescribed. Useless and actually harmful products. After several days of nonuse, I tried it again and by the next day, my rash had returned furiously. So, I must have been allergic to an ingredient which I did not recognize. In short, it seemed like a great serum until I got my rash, twice. People who do not have allergies will most likely enjoy using it"

It burned a little bit on contact with my skin, which I should've known would happen since this does contain Actives. It definitely is pricey, and I've found replacing the cap and plug with a spray cap (I just took a 1 fl oz travel spray bottle and replaced the cap on the original bottle) makes it last WORLDS longer!

It has a liquid but slightly viscous gel texture. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a sticky residue. The pump dispenser works well and comes with a cap for hygiene.

It's fragrance free and essential oil free. The first ingredient is Vitamin Fruit extract (aka Hippophae Rhamnoides or seaberry extract), which has antioxidant and soothing effects. It also contains hyaluronic acid for moisture retention and both niacinamide and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) for brightening. However, it's mostly the niacinamide doing the work there since ascorbic acid will degrade quickly from light exposure in a transparent bottle, and is also much lower down in the ingredient list.

It's made in Korea. The box has a sticker seal, and both the bottom of the bottle and the outer box are clearly marked with the expiration date, and the full ingredients are printed in both English and Korean on the box, but not the bottle.
The ingredients are:
Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Methylpropanediol, 1, 2-Hexandiol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cyclohexasiloxane, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Xantan Gum, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Carbomer, Fructooligosaccharides, Disodium EDTA, Beta-Glucan, Tromethamine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Water, Ascorbic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin"

Each of them is $20-35 full size, so I thought this would be a nice way to try them. To begin with, the I'm From Honey mask arrives half-full, so just we aware of that. I apply about one fingertip length's worth to my face before I shower, hoping that it will lock in some hydration. Typically my face gets tight after showering just from me splashing water over it - as the water evaporates, my face feels dry. This mask didn't help. I've used it 4 times, and it just doesn't add any noticeable hydration for me. The two toners are sort of a similar story...they're not bad, but I wouldn't run out to buy them. Almost every other toner I've tried I like as much or more. I just feel lie overall I'm From products are not worth their high price tags relative to other Asian Beauty products. I'm glad I tried this before buying full size versions,"

Each of these products offer something different but help overall with my needs. I have dry skin with redness on my cheeks and occasional breakouts on my forehead from an autoimmune disease so my ""normal"" skin has phases of sensitivity and redness when touched depending on the time of year. These products are awesome.

The honey mask isn't one I use every day - more like once a week when I have time because I have other soothing options so if this all you have you could do it 3 times a week - not sure if I'd do it every day tbh. Honey is great for dry skin and irritated skin so I fit both - you paint this on with a plastic applicator, wait a bit and gently remove it (I use the makeup eraser instead of a washcloth so its not abrasive).

The MUGWORT Essence - I can't brag on this enough if you are inflamed - if I had a day where my cheeks hate me for whatever reason (finicky rosacea is finicky) this is my go to right after washing my face. or removing the honey mask. I'll admit on one particularly BAD day it didn't feel as soothing as the creams that followed but it did help the redness go down so it was worth it. Best ever - I apply it almost every day.

The RICE TONER - okay so I have a hit and miss with this (but it's not its fault) my auto-immune disease means I can't have much rice in my diet and I figure absorbing it into my skin is just as bad. So this toner I don't use every day - but if that weren't the case I would because it is AMAZING and so SOOTHING. Highly recommend as a main toner for those without hashimotos

5 stars easily earned - sometimes it's so popular the small kit is sold out and unavailable - the bigger versions are WORTH it - I have those too. If you can get this it is great as a present too."

I have been wanting to try out something from this brand, ""I'm From"" for a while. The product was in a pretty large box and the container is larger than I had expected. With that said I think the container might be too large? Reason I say this is because the pads are a mess in there and slid all over the place. Thankfully there's some mini tongs that could be used to grab the individual pads. Another good point is that there was a freshness seal on the container so nothing could leak out.

I use this as a toner/essence. The material of the pad feels very soft and plush, kind of like thin fabric. The essence viscosity is typical of toners and essences. Can use this as a spot treatment mask for different parts of the face rather than as a toner type. There's a lot of liquid in the jar though, so the pads come soaked.

It seems gentle and moisturizing and hasn't irritated the skin. It doesn't have any added fragrances and/or oils which is a plus so I'm not sure where the scent for the product comes from. It is a light pleasant scent though."

I like the essence itself. The pads are heavily saturated in the essence. The box and packaging say there is 60 pads included and there is extra essence in the container to keep the pads well saturated. When I opened the container the pads were all tossed about the containers instead of nice neat and stacked like other products I have received like this.

I was nervous that this product would make my face a little red or pink due to the use of beets in this product and because the instructions also say to rinse your face after use and then pat remaining essence onto your skin. There is no need to worry about this essence making your face red or pink. The only thing I saw and felt after use of this essence was that my skin had a dewy glow to it. I did not rinse my face after use or remove the product. I just let it absorb which didn't take more than a couple minutes. The one thing that was disappointing about this essence is that the pad just completely shreds and falls apart during application. One of my favorite things about this essence pad is that it fits my foreo ufo 2 device. I love products that pair well with not only my skin care routines but also my skin care devices.

Overall I really like this essence pad. I love that it comes with tweezers to help keep your other pads clean and free of contamination. I really like the look and feel that this essence gives my skin. I see a nice bright dewy glow when I use this product. It doesn’t leave my skin sticky or tacky at all and it fully absorbs in matter of minutes. And I LOVE that this works with my foreo ufo 2 device, just keep in mind the pads do shred very easily. This essence has really good ingredients and I’ll probably end up using this maybe once or twice a week to help clean and brighten my skin tone. I would definitely recommend this essence pad to help brighten, exfoliate and prevent signs of aging. Very pleasantly happy with this item."

The pads are triple-layered and hold a whopping 260ml of essence, which is enough to cover my face and neck twice. I noticed that my skin felt moisturized and looked glowing after using them.

What impressed me the most was that these pads also helped calm down my redness. I have some areas of my face that tend to get irritated and turn red easily, but the beet extract in these pads seemed to have a calming effect on my skin. Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a hydrating and soothing skincare product."

After cleansing, you place the circles on your skin wherever you need some extra hydration, or to calm redness. You let it sit for a little while, just like a sheet mask, then you can wipe any remaining product from the pads over your face before discarding. No need to rinse your face after, just let the product soak in.

This stuff is pretty good and really does leave my skin feeling fresh and hydrated. I like to use a thicker moisturizer after to really lock in the hydration. My skin is mildly sensitive and didn't have any negative reaction to these and did genuinely seem calmed. If you're looking to add a regular mask regimen to your skin care routine, this is a great way to do it!"

I use 2-3 pads for the whole face and use the same for my neck. I leave these on for 5 minutes before swiping on my face, neck and chest area.

Doesn't have a beet scent and the texture is like a sheet mask which makes it perfect for masking! Beet root extract is an antioxidant to help brighten and improve the skin's texture. These pads are good for all skin types if you're not sensitive to the ingredients. It also has niacinamide and carrot root and apple fruit extract -- these are amazing for brightening and minimizing the appearance of pores! I noticed improvement as my skin tans easily under the sun even in the cold months.

Do check the PAO (period of opening) to make sure you use up the product within the specified period."

It has no scent at all, which is good. That makes me think that it probably is a natural product, as beets don’t really have a scent, and this is supposed to be 85% beet extract. No fragrance added is a good thing, because you don’t want to add fragrance to the skin on your face. It can result in blemishes and bad skin reactions. I’ve been using this ampoule serum for about a week, and have noticed a difference in the smoothness and brightness of my skin, and it looks like my pores have been reduced. I always use a rose water toner first, then spread the beet energy ampoule over my face. It absorbs well. Then I added a dab of moisturizer, and my skin loves it! I use it morning and night. All the instructions and information on the box and bottle are in Korean, with English translation. Korea has made great innovations in skin care products, and this product is definitely the real thing, from Korea."

It also brightens and evens the tone, softening the red areas on my forehead. The squalane in the formula is also great at relaxing my skin. I love using it after shaving to calm my skin down.

It’s paired with squalane, another excellent moisturizer that doesn’t feel too heavy or greasy. I use this ampoule after my essence as it’s thicker but it still sinks in nicely, leaving my skin a bit dewy and tacky. I follow up with my usual moisturizer.

I like that my skin feels more moisturized and hydrated when using this ampoule, especially in the summer when I’m much more diligent about sunscreen use which can sometimes cause my skin to feel dry if the formula has alcohol in it. This ampoule has helped to keep my skin feeling and looking normal – not dry or tight nor overly oily or shiny. It’s a nice way to add a bit of a moisture boost to your routine without having to use a heavy duty moisturizer. It’s something I would buy again.

It dries down completely matte although it does take some time to blend in. It's definitely not for everyone because it does leave a bit of a white cast on the skin which I assume is the ""brightening"" effect of rice in the sunscreen.
Those who are sensitive may not enjoy the light floral fragrance in the sunscreen but I didn't note any breakouts or irritation while using it myself.
It's a little on the thicker side and mixed well with water based foundation. It didn't pill up on the skin but do make sure to not use this with a serum or any silicone based products to avoid that."

It doesn't smell too much, which is also a plus. It is a small amount compared to the giant tubes of Costco sized sunscreen, so keep that in mind."

It is very light, and does not feel greasy or heavy like some other sunscreen. I knew that I could always trust a Korean sunscreen, and true to its reputation, this rice sunscreen protects the skin from UVA/UVB without being too oily or too drying. With 40% rice extract, it is also beneficial to the skin as rice extract can reduce UV damage, wrinkle, hyperpigmentation, dead skin cells, and increase skin ceramide production. It is also reef safe and easily absorbs into the skin without leaving any white cast."

So, as long as you know this is not something that went through any US cosmetic approval and doesn't even have the normal FDA sunscreen ingredient list you may find it a little charming. I have no idea what percentage of Zinc is in here, and should you really trust the SPF 50 if they weren't tested by the FDA? Personally I would feel better it is doing what it says if they went through the approval.

However, I hate chemical sunscreens (avobenzone, octinoxate, oxybenzone etc.) and this is clearly using zinc, the 41% rice extract feels great, a lot like glycerine, it rubs in clear and does not leave white residue if you put it on first on a clean face. I have not noticed any irritation or breakouts after using it daily. Overall I am glad I tried it but you can get something from a trusted brand for about the same price, double the quantity, and with an actual drug label that offers consumers some protection."

The key ingredient in this cream is Tremella Fuciformis Extract which is a polysaccharide (a big sugar molecule) coming from the edible fruit bodies of the Silver Ear mushroom in China. It's claimed to be an awesome moisturizer with slightly greater water-holding capacities than Hylauronic Acid. I found that this is very true. I have super dry skin that is also sensitive and this worked wonders on my winter dry skin. It felts a bit like snail mucin at first since it is a bit sticky but there is no snail mucin in this. It left my skin with a good protective barrier. This is the second cream I have tried from this brand and have loved both.

This comes in a pretty mushroom-colored glass jar and the package is safety-sealed. It is made in Korea and expires in 10.25 but should be used within 12 months of opening.

This is a small jar of cream. It doesn’t really have a safety seal. The top of the box has a sticker sealing it but the bottom of the box is unsealed. Anyone wanting to open it undetected could open and close it there with no evidence of tampering. The cream goes on easy. It absorbs right away. It has low / no scent. It leaves you feeling moisturized but not so heavy you can’t wear this during the day. It doesn’t leave me feeling like I have an extra layer on me. This is good since ai live in sunny FL and if my cream is too heavy my face sweats profusely. I like it but it needs a safety seal.

I’m From Rice Toner, Serum, and Cream Set Review

I recently started using the I’m From Rice Toner, Serum, and Cream Set, and I am absolutely impressed! This Korean skincare trio is a game-changer for achieving glowing, hydrated, and smooth “glass skin.”

Each product contains rice extract, known for its brightening and moisturizing properties, and the results are truly visible. The toner is lightweight and instantly hydrates the skin without feeling sticky. The serum adds an extra layer of nourishment, leaving the skin looking radiant and soft. The cream is rich but absorbs quickly, providing deep hydration that lasts all day.

After just a few uses, my skin looks more even-toned, bright, and plump. If you’re looking for a skincare routine that delivers a healthy, glowing complexion, I highly recommend this set. It’s perfect for anyone wanting that dewy, glass skin effect!"

I noticed my chin was smoother and softer than normal so I started using it on my whole face. I haven't noticed any irritation so as far as I'm concerned this is good.

I was really nervous to try them because they have grapefruit and orange oils which can be irritating to the skin. I believe they are the major exfoliators in the product.

I have really sensitive skin and have reactions to many common products like coconut oil or niacinamide, however I didn't have any issues with this. I probably would prefer something without the essential oils and just the licorice to make sure my skin doesn't ever develop an allergy. However I do have uneven texture on my forehead and that has been slightly improved. There's no guarantee it's from this product as hormones can change things as well.

Overall I'm happy with the product and will use it until I run out. I'll have to see if I notice consistent changes over time in order to fully recommend it. I do think if you have sensitive skin you could use this 1-2 times a week and that would be sufficient for at least getting rid of some of the dead skin cells.

I prefer this product to their rice mask that has little rice granules in it. That product actually cuts my skin and causes irritation. This is much more gentle.

Edit* It's been over a month later and I actually love these. I think they have been one of the things that have led to smoother skin texture for me. I feel like it's the effects most people get from acids, but acids are generally too strong for me. This is both soothing and exfoliating. I am definitely tempted to repurchase in the future. This product finally lives up to the hype I'd heard from the brand and I'm really happy I kept with trying these. I would prefer this in a bottle vs pads as it's better for the environment, but the pads are nice if you are in a rush or traveling."

Licorice has many bio-active compounds that have anti-inflammatory, brightening (by slowing melanin production), and anti-oxidant (which helps reduce damage that causes aging) properties. It's especially recommended for sensitive, reddened skin. I'm from uses a traditional extraction process that results in more bioactives in the final product. These pads also have some compounds found in Centella asiatica (cica, tiger grass) which is also great to soothe and help with inflammation.

These toner pads have a textured and smooth side so you can lightly move across your skin to gently exfoliate and/or use the smooth side to gently pat on/leave on for a couple of minutes. I found they left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. I always squeeze out any excess toner and use it on my hands when I'm done so I don't waste any, and I also thought these soothed my hands, which happened to be a little irritated after some house cleaning chores.

This has mild fragrance. It lingers for a short time, and one of the fragrance ingredients is orange peel oil, which can cause allergies/irritation in some and garners a rating of 7 on EWG because of that. It also has grapefruit peel oil, which is a bit less problematic for allergies/irritation and gets a EWG score of 3. Yuka, which doesn't penalize fragrance ingredients as much, gives this a 93/100.

These are really 4.5 stars for me since I've also used some amazing toner pads and I don't think these will displace those from my top picks, but I am rounding up to 5 for the high quality ingredients from a reputable brand.

Note: someone gave this a bad review because they got it in their eyes. This product says on the box to avoid the eye area; it's meant to be used after cleansing as a toner step (cleanse, tone, serum/ampoule, moisturizer, and sunscreen (AM only))."

B0CLTX9HTD__1,B0CLTX9HTD,R1EDUJL0V2MQNB,Lover of All Things Beauty,I'm From Licorice Calming Cream 1.59 Fl Oz,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","This comes in a nice outer product box that’s sealed. It’s made in Korea. Ingredients on the tube aren’t in English BUT they do have them in English on the outer product box, so that’s nice at least. There’s an expiration date on it (for me it is 9/17/26). It comes in a nice squeeze tube that has a tinfoil safety seal beneath the lid.

The main ingredient in this is actually Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract (Ricorice Exosome) and it even gives the concentration - 58%. The next ingredient is water. I liked seeing Licorice was actually the first ingredient, and really liked they included the amount too! This also has another type of licorice extract in it - Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract as the 9th ingredient. On the ingredient list on the box, it doesn’t state the percentage of this. But the ingredient list on the product page says it’s 0.05%. The 23rd ingredient is Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, which is actual licorice. Again, the ingredient list on the box doesn’t give the concentration, but the ingredient list here on the product page says 1,000ppm. Just for reference, 1ppm = 0.0001% (or 10,000 ppm = 1%). So 1,000 ppm means 0.1%. So there’s quite a few different types of licorice root extracts as well as actual licorice.

This has a very subtle scent to it. I’m guessing from the licorice? But it’s hard to place because it’s so faint. This is more like a gel than a cream to me. I have dry skin. When it’s colder, my skin gets extremely dry. So I prefer creams since they’re usually heavier and more moisturizing for me. Gel creams are usually thinner and more lightweight, so they usually aren’t moisturizing enough for me. This definitely is thin and lightweight. It feels nice going on. It glides on the skin easily. It absorbs quickly. There’s no residue or tacky feeling left on the skin. To me, this doesn’t live up to the “intense hydration” claim. Right now my skin is really dry and this isn’t moisturizing enough. However, I find it works well enough to use before makeup. It’s thin and lightweight, which is usually best for under makeup. I do my usual skincare routine when I first wake up, using a different moisturizer at the end of it. I let that settle in for about 30 minutes (more if I can). Then right before applying my makeup, I’ll apply a thin layer of this to get a little extra moisturizing and this has been working well for me when used that way. I feel in the summer when my skin is more normal leaning dry, this will work well as my main moisturizer. But right now, as my main moisturizer, I need something more hydrating than this. This would probably be great for those with normal or oily skin. But for people like me with really dry skin, I don’t think this is enough.

I also don’t think it lived up to the “reduction in redness” claim. It says that this “contains oil-soluble Licorice extract with a certified skin tone-evening effect that minimizes redness and pigmentation scars. Enhance your skin's radiance and evenness.” So far, this hasn’t helped reduce my redness or reduce pigmentation from scars (post acne marks). Maybe with continued use it will. But as of now, it hasn’t done that.

Overall, I like it but don’t love it. Like I said, it might work better for me when my skin is more normal leaning dry. But given this claimed to give “intense hydration” - I just don’t think it lives up to that. If you’re looking for something with intense hydration, I don’t think this is it. But if you’re looking for a lightweight cream that has a kind of gel consistency, this would work well.

It doesn’t aggravate my facial redness and has not broken me out so that’s a plus.

I haven’t noticed any rubbing off on my pillowcase. I’m not sure what causes the cooling sensation when first applied as there isn’t any mint or menthol that I can find, but it doesn’t burn or sting, and it goes away after a couple seconds.

I applied some foundation on top and it didn't pill or cause any blending issues.

It does have a slight smell that I can't place. It's not unpleasant but it's also not a perfume-y scent. It's kind of like bark, perhaps. I don't love it or hate it; it's just there. Not too strong.

I have combination skin that tends to be sensitive and this seems pretty inert on my skin. I think this is great if you don't want any actives or extra bells and whistles, just a good moisturizer."

To me, it smells like a chocolate tootsie roll. I don’t mind the scent at all, but if you’re super sensitive, it may not be for you. I like the cream, but I’m not wowed by it. It doesn’t really provide me with as much hydration as I thought it would. Oddly enough, sometimes it leaves me feeling a bit dry, but again, maybe that’s because it’s not doing much in terms of boosting or retaining moisture. I also don’t find it to be soothing either, so it’s just okay to me. Don’t hate it but also don’t love it. I’ll use it up, but this isn’t something I’d repurchase."

After applying, my skin looks noticeably calmer and more balanced. The dropper dispenser works great and I haven't had any issues with it. Overall, I would highly recommend this if you're looking for a soothing ampoule.

Typically ampoules are more highly concentrated products than serums so I expect this to be a short-term 'extra' until my skin shows enough improvement, rather than a consistent daily product - thus I think the price is reasonable.
It goes on smoothly, is just slightly sticky when first applied but absorbs and dries completely within a minute or two. I follow with fairly heavy winter moisturizer and had no issues with compatibility. My skin did look less irritated in the morning.
It comes in a unique bottle with a pop-up cap: twist the cap off slightly and the top pops up, keep twisting to remove the entire top and dropper and use that pop-up button to dispense the ampoule. When you screw the cap back onto the bottle the top retracts itself again. There's something very cute about it that I just love aesthetically.

It has soothing, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. It's especially recommended for sensitive, reddened skin. Beta-sitosterol also has shown anti-inflammatory properties in studies, and malt extract contains antioxidant phenols, so it can help soothe troubled skin and protect against damage that causes aging. Because I have reactive skin, I was excited to try this. I found that this product left my skin feeling baby smooth and was soothing. It left a slight stickiness for a few minutes, probably not enough to interfere with makeup application (although I can't test since I don't wear foundation), but it was completely absorbed in about 15 minutes.

I'm from is a reputable Korean beauty brand, and I use one of their other products regularly. I'm from uses a traditional extraction process that results in more bioactives in the final product.

One thing I find frustrating is that so many products marked to sensitive skin have a ton of fragrance ingredients which are notorious for irritating sensitive skin. Thankfully, there are products like this that buck the trend with no added fragrance and have a relatively short ingredient list. With the exception of licorice, all the ingredients are EWG green. Because licorice really has bioactives, it garners an EWG score of 4, but note that retinols also get more cautionary scores because they actually do something. Licorice, in studies, is very promising for skin, and unless you have an allergy to it, which is always possible, I think it's a highly desired ingredient for many skincare needs.

This has a very mild smell from the ingredients. Instead of smelling like licorice, it had a sweet smell to me that surprised me. Looking over the ingredient list, I think it might be from the malt extract since it reminds me of the scent I get when tasting diluted distilled malt, with maybe just a hint of the sweet part of fresh fennel root (but not the ""licorice"" part). It is very mild and dissipates quickly. I smell things more acutely than the vast majority of people, so I recommend this to those who are scent-sensitive like me.

If there is some confusion over ampoules vs serums, know there is NO official definition as these are more marketing terms than anything (one reviewer apparently objected to the terminology). This can justly be called an ampoule based on the high concentration, 73%, of licorice, but you can incorporate it in your routine as needed. I experience unexplained redness/rashes from apparently environmental, non-skincare products regularly, so I plan on incorporating this in my arsenal of products to quickly soothe my irritated skin."

3⭐️- NOT BAD. I definitely would recommend it as a second resort

When I got this serum (ampoule is small capsules, which this is not), the box was sealed, but the cap wasn’t on tight, so a minimal amount had leaked and dried up.

Licorice root extract is well known for brightening, calming redness, and soothing. I like that this serum has a simple ingredient list and is fragrance-free, which is good for my sensitive skin.

This serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly. It doesn’t seem to soothe my skin all day, and I find myself cleansing my skin early in the evening and applying my usual nightly serums, which this is not.

HOW I USE: AM
1 - Cleanse my face,
2 - I apply 4 drops of this serum (ampoule) on my face.
I always dry my face & hands thoroughly before applying any serums. Then, I ensure the serum absorbs into my skin before applying moisturizer. If I don’t, I get a sticky, icky feel.
3 - LAST, I finish with my usual moisturizer.

I'm From Licorice Soothing Ampoule works well with the other skincare products that are part of my facial regimen.

EXPIRATION DATE: 02/07/2026
I always check for an expiration date before using, ESPECIALLY with health & beauty products.

Korean skincare is among the best I've tried. This is a ampoule. I absolutely love that Licorise Root is the primary ingredient (at 73%). Ampoules, from my understanding, are similar to serums, but they are more potent. So they aren't used every day, like a serum, but are more for when you just need something extra. However this ampoule instructs to use it daily morning and at night. I would not want to run out of it.

The ampoule absorbs quickly. My skin is much softer from it. It also feels light and watery going on. But leaves a soft barrier on my skin.

They've always absorbed and retained well for me! This one is no different.

I like anything plant based... we have mugwort and garlic in this (yuck). Such great botanicals together that I would never ingest! Why not slather it on my face? Thankfully, there is no odor, maybe slightly muggy but it fades quickly. The texture is rich and doesn't feel oily/sticky. The dropper does not work well for me but the product is otherwise fantastic for hydration and firmness. My skin is not irritated enough to speak for soothing the skin.

Reasonably priced vs Korean skincare products. I would recommend trying this serum!"

I also love Korean skincare products, so I jumped at the chance to try this serum. First off, there is NO scent to it- at all. I don't know if I have a sensitive olfactory but even products that say ""fragrance-free"" have a bit of some sort of scent from whatever ingredients are used. I was quite surprised that it had literally no scent at all to me. I spread it onto my face, which felt really nice. One of the biggest things I hate about some facial products is when it leaves a sticky or greasy feeling, and I was really surprised this one did. That bummed me out because I really cannot stand that feeling. I thought maybe it was because I used a face wipe to clean my face rather than a cleanser (I was being lazy) so I tried it on the back of my hands which are very dry from the cold weather. I had high hopes, but, while it was not as bad as on my face, it did have a bit of an off-feeling to me. After waiting a while, my face did seem to absorb it a bit more, so it wasn't as sticky as it previously was... I want to love it, I do... but with that said, I don't hate it either. It actually did help the dry areas on my hand, which is why I am torn."

I was a little worried that this might have a scent, since the mask smells really 'earthy' but it is pretty much unscented as described. It is also non-sticky, so it can be used both day and night. It doesn't affect my other skincare products and I haven't had any issues with pilling. It absorbs very quickly and feels calming.

My face did feel cleaner, softer and only slightly tight. It did however impart some dryness, which already having very dry skin, has always made it hard for me to find the perfect face wash.

I probably won't rely on this for everyday use, but as an occasionally exfoliant and I have found applying a moisturizing cream after using this does help to negate its drying properties."

I don’t need much of this cleanser, just a little bit lathers nicely and removes all traces of oil and impurities. I don’t wear a lot of makeup but it seems to effectively remove what I do wear. Not sure if it would work as well on a full face of makeup.
I love that this cleanser contains niacinamide, a favorite ingredient of mine for its age-fighting, brightening, and oil controlling properties.

One thing to note is that it doesn't foam up much, but personally, that's not a problem for me as long as it cleans effectively.

My face feels very clean and soft after using, no dryness whatsoever, even with the additional acid blends that aid in exfoliation.

If there is a scent, I can barely detect it and thankfully there is no added fragrance.

Among face care products, the facial cleanser is probably the least impactful, but still an important part of the process, it might make even more of a difference to use all parts of the skin care regime in the “I’m From” line but in the meantime I liked the whipped cleanser, it’s creamy and lathers nicely, no overpowering fragrance and no reaction on my sometimes sensitive skin.

You really only need to use a very small amount for a nice lather, probably much less than you would expect to use. At ~$24 (at time of review) it initially seems on the high side for a cleanser, but factoring in how little you need to use each day, one tube will last quite a while, so it’s a good value for a nice quality cleanser.

For dry skin, it’s not overly hydrating, but presumably following up with the other products regardless of brand, it will more responsible for locking in moisture.

The tube comes sealed and expiration appears to be 2027.

My initial impression is very good, I’m looking forward to continue using it and other items in the “I’m From” line."

The cleanser foams up/lathers alright and rinses off easily.

At $24 for 150 mL, it's priced somewhat higher than the average price of most common cleansers. Skincare is very much to one's preferences, so because it worked well for me, I'd recommend it but it's definitely something you'd need to try out before regularly purchasing."

The first time I used it, I used a pea sized amount of soap. It was way too much. You can use a small amount approximately 1/3 the size of a pea. This container is going to last me a long time. When you wash your face, it gets your face clean without leaving it squeaky. It does not strip all the moisture from your face. Your skin is soft and silky when finished."

The texture is soft and creamy, it lathers well, and it’s very gentle on my skin. After washing, my skin feels plump, moisturized, and clean. This facewash contains AHA, BHA, PHA, LHA, and rice bran extract, which gently exfoliate and soften the skin. I didn’t experience any breakouts or reactions after using it.

I primarily use their rice line so I was thrilled to see that the rice whip facial cleanser is now available to order through Amazon. I was previously using their mugwort gel cleanser, which is lovely, but I’m so happy to have a full set of the rice products.

My skin is mature with a tendency toward dryness. This cleanser is wonderfully creamy, lathers and rinses well. I always follow up with the I’m From rice toner, serum and cream morning and night. This is a fantastic addition to my routine, I’m pleased with the results and I see no reason to change to a different product or skin care line anytime soon. Highly recommended."

It lathers fairly well without requiring significant amount to do its job and it's reasonably foamy and rich. Interestingly though the apparent richness doesn't necessarily translates to oily results but rather the opposite although it's not necessarily drier for me personally in comparison to most other cleansers for sensitive skin/dry skin out there.

≡ Value
All things considered, this is a fairly decent cleanser that cleanse reasonably well albeit it still leaves my skin a bit dry for my liking although it's not worse than most others. It's somewhat reasonably priced at $24 (150 ml/5.07 fl.oz) in comparison to many other equally effective facial cleansers or gels with similar performance, if not better.

Granted, it certainly costs more than your average face wash even from well-known brands such as Dove, L'Oreal, or Neutrogena etc; however, everyone is different and you'd never know until you try it yourself so it's quite possible that it's gonna be well worth the investment if it suits your particular needs. Your mileage might vary."

The facial cleanser has a nice soft whipped consistency and lathers well. You don’t need much at all. I find it takes a few extra rinses to wash it off my face, but wow, iit cleans so well! I have combination skin and thought this does a fantastic job removing the oiliness without drying or irritating my face. I also tried the rice toner. You have to shake it up to mix it together.

I use a lot of products with active ingredients for anti-aging and hyperpigmentation and sometimes I overdo it and aggravate my inherently sensitive skin. In the past, several so-called gentle cleansers have set my skin on fire (metaphorically). Even cleansers that are generally good can sting when I’ve overtaxed my skin. I was shocked when I used this cleanser and felt *absolutely nothing.* That seemed impossible because there’s always some patch on my face that I’ve accidently scratched or irritated in some way. The other surprising aspect was the complete lack of scent. In comparison to my usual experience of washing my face, this felt like some kind of weird sensory deprivation experiment.
The rice whip cleanser lathers well, cleans effectively, and rinses completely. It is a big winner for me! I’m just not sure if I can justify the level of expenditure. It will depend on how long the tube lasts. The rice toner is nice too, but I’m so impressed with the cleanser that it’s hard for me to pay attention to the toner.
Be advised: Both the cleanser and toner have niacinamide fairly high on the ingredient list. Whereas this is a soothing ingredient for many, it is an irritant for some."

I'm ot sure of the logic of having the toner only in the smaller size and not the larger one, but regardless you only need a few drops of the toner to wet a cotton ball sufficiently.

I used the cleanser first. There are two ways to use, the instructions say. One is to lather first in wet hands and apply, which is what I did. Lathers well, rinses off easily, feels great. No scent that I could tell. I liked this cleanser very much. The other way you can use is for a deepr clean: apply without lathering first, then wet and lather on face and leave for a few minutes. I haven't tried that way yet.

This is a very nice set, very nicely packaged and feels nice and clean. Quite happy."

I have sensitive skin and rosacea, and upon using the combo of this face wash and toner, my face immediately showed patches of red dots on the cheek areas. After the red irritations were gone, I retried the products again wanting to know whether the skin irritations were caused by the face wash or the toner, so I used them separately at different times.

The face wash is actually fine. It lathers well under water and smooth on the face. But as far as cleansing goes, the result is no different from other cleansers that I have used - this one is not particularly hydrated or showing obvious good results in reducing pores.

The toner, I believe, was the one that caused my skin irritation. I used it again followed by cleansing my face with my normal facial cleanser, and soon the red patches showed up again on my cheeks. So for whatever reason, the ingredients in this toner do not sit well on my skin. I will probably not going to use this set of products again. It might work for someone else, but just not for me."

The 150 ml / 5.08 oz Rice Whip Facial Cleanser, and a small travel set of the same cleanser and a Rice Toner, were thoughtfully arranged inside a sealed box. The box lists ingredients and directions (English only with one line of Korean text). There’s no ingredient list on the individual items, but each has directions in English along with some Korean text. A bit of the English text is awkwardly worded. All three items had silver safety seals under their lids.

I followed the somewhat vague cleanser directions to “apply a certain amount onto wet hands and create lather. Gently massage the lather onto wet skin…” Not sure what a “certain amount” was, I used more than I should have the first time. A very small amount of this soft, foamy cleanser was enough to create a lather that easily covered my face and neck. To my nose there’s a slight scent (that I can’t name) as I’m actively washing my face, and then it’s gone. There’s no vague “fragrance” ingredient in either product.

The 1.01 oz milky-white toner is small, but there’s enough to figure out if you like it if it’s a new product to you. It’s lightweight and it absorbs quickly for me, but you need to remember to shake it first, which I’m not a fan of. To my nose this toner is unscented.

These were my first rice/rice bran extract products, and my acne-prone, combination skin liked them. For me they were both gentle and lightly moisturizing. The cleanser cleaned my face well, and both products left my skin feeling balanced. My acne-prone skin really likes niacinamide/vitamin B3, which is in both products (and in the active I followed these up with in the mornings), and I experienced no irritation, redness, or spots after using both for a week.

“Vegan friendly” and cruelty free per the brand, but the only marking is “Vegan” on the toner. The products I received in June 2024 were all marked with icons stating they should be good for at least 12 months. Each also had an EXP date in March 2027. Made in Korea"

I don't know how I feel about the toner. You must shake it first before applying it. The toner is liquid so that you could use a cotton square. I prefer to pour it on my hand and rub it in. It does not leave your skin feeling smooth, and I have another that does, so I may not finish the bottle.

I recommend trying this product. In the future, I may purchase the face wash again. However, I will not be buying the toner."

My face feels clean but not dry after using it. I feel like it did a good job removing makeup, grime, and all the rest that accumulates on my face during the day. It compares well to a brand name cleanser that I tried. It smells good, slightly sweet & fruity, but not strong. It’s not a floral scent. The scent doesn’t linger after rinsing. I do find it a little bit hard to thoroughly rinse off. I like to use a wet washcloth to gently remove, then rinse. One thing that is really good about this, is that a little goes a long way. It only takes a pea sized amount to clean my face. So, I think this is a pretty good value."

This product comes in a good sized container that snaps shut securely to prevent the pads from drying out. The entire stack of pads is saturated very well with toner. It's amazing how much product is in one thin pad when you use it on your skin. One pad is definitely plenty for your face and neck.

They have a very light scent. I do find that my skin has a slight tacky feeling to it after using these pads, but I believe that is because they are formulated to hydrate and moisturize. This is an advantage because a lot of other toners can dry out skin and strip moisture."

✅ Pads are thick and saturated, you can cover your whole face and neck
✅ Very moisturizing, you sometimes don't need to follow up with cream. Definitely adds a bit of glow and works great under other glowing formulas

As a K-beauty lover, I was very excited to try the rice toner pads.

The rice used in the toner is specially cultivated in Yeoju, Korea. The ingredient list itself is not a mile long, pretty tame compared to others. These are meant to help even skin tone and provide moisture.

For those wondering, it does list niacinamide as the 5th ingredient. However, the formula is incredibly gentle. I'm someone whose skin can't tolerate higher percentage niacinamide, but these have not irritated my skin at all. That being said, I have only been using them every other day as part of my AM routine. I needed to ensure my skin could handle it first, and it's going great so far. I'll probably start using them daily soon.

Skin type: combo leaning dry/dehydrated, type 1 rosacea on cheeks. I hate that I have additional texture on my cheeks, so I'm excited that my skin is handling the rice toner pads well. You can apply pads to the face and wear them for up to 30 minutes, or just pat them/swipe them over your face to soak in the toner. I typically do the latter, as I don't have time for the former lol.

Pros: so soothing, they feel great going on. Doesn't cause any separation or pilling under makeup or other skincare products. They really do add a nice additional layer of hydration, which my skin desperately needs. They seem to help calm down minor skin irritation. I've started a new moisturizer recently too, but I do have to say that my skin is looking more plump and brighter. Love the little tweezers and the packaging. Love that the toner soaks in easily and doesn't leave a film once dry.

Cons: can't really think of any! I really like these."

The little tweezers to remove the pad from the stack are a nice touch, but they are still a little tough to grab individual sheets...so not sure how much more effective these are than just using your nails to grab them."

Additionally, the tongs that come with the pads has a super handy, fitted a lot in the top of the jar that allows them to be neatly stored. The toner pads themselves are not what I would necessarily consider true toner pads- rather, they feel much more like super moisturizing serum pads. That is absolutely the only reason I am giving them a 4!instead of a 5. I still would recommend them with the caveat that I am doing so because they are truly moisturize and feel incredibly on my skin."

I am able to put on a toner pad for each of my cheeks where my skin is driest, while not doing the oilier area in my T-zone. Much more comfortable than doing a whole sheet mask and easier to do more regularly.

You can also just swipe a pad over your whole face to get a layer of the product all over. The toner pads are soaked in a solution that is thicker than regular toner but slightly thinner than serum. It is absorbed quickly but does leave something behind on the skin afterward, so I think this is best for the cold and dry months. This is my overall impression of the I'm from Rice line- everything I've tried from it is very hydrating.

The pads come in a round plastic jar and there is a set of plastic tweezers that store in their own little holder on the inside of the lid. Makes it much easier and more hygienic to grab a single pad."

It’s not heavily fragranced and the toner pads have a good amount of liquid. They sweep across my face easily and I didn’t feel any irritation.

It works well under a thicker cream at night. During the day, it works well under sunscreen.
The active ingredients (niacinamide, panthenol and vitamin C) has helped keep my acne skin calm and less inflamed when I'm going through a hormonal break out.

Overall, I think it's a comparable cream to many Korean gel creams I've used. It's safe and from a reputable brand and I think it's affordable. Would consider repurchasing as part of my permanent skincare regiment."

This gel cream is very light and almost odorless and absorbs easily. I like that it feels soothing and cool on my sensitive skin and it moisturized well enough without irritation. Since this product is generally considered to be aimed at oily/combination skin and healing damage, I'm going to use it sparingly in the winter (as I normally switch to stronger lipid-based face creams this time of year) and try to save it for the hot humid weather. It's a great product for my skin type and comes from the maker of several longtime popular skincare products that AB users keep on their HG list."

If you find most moisturizers too heavy , if you have sensitive skin, or if you breakout easily, then this is for you. If your skin i very dry and needs intense moisture, then this alone may not be enough. Personally I like how this feels on my skin and will use it on those days when I just don't want anything heavy."

I toned my skin and skipped serum so I could feel the effects of this gel. By lightweight, I mean it feels like it's almost not even there as it is absorbed so quickly. I think I was skimpy in my first application so I added a little more. I like how my face feels, cool and calm, a very natural feel and my skin tone looks great.
Product comes with a little scoop so you don't have to put your fingers in the jar.

It's unscented gel and feels cool on the skin but after it's absorbed, my skin didn't feel any different and didn't feel moisturized. It says it reduces heat and helps irritation so maybe it's good for someone with acne or other skin irritation, probably good for oily skin.

It feels more liquidy than cream moisturizers, maybe just a tad sticky, taking a moment to absorb, but after any apparent evidence of its material (the gel) presence, my face feels wonderful! Slightly cool, smooth and gently hydrated. Very, very pleasant!

I am a convinced fan in Korean Skin Care products. Not because it is a rage currently, but because of the results I'm receiving in using them. Not that all Korean skin care products are created equal. Some may definitely help more than others. And with that said, I really like this Vitamin Tree Water Gel! The ingredients are of the nature that have been proven to assist in keeping healthier facial skin and improving the appearance of it. I have done some reading on the research of these ingredients. The internet can provide that for anyone that cares to do it. And I for one, want to know what I am putting on my face. I tell my sister, ""When there's a doubt, and evidence of impurities, then there's no doubt, about tossing it out!"" So as silly as it may sound, that's my personal view.

The size is rather generous in comparison to many on the market. You get 2.64 oz./ 75g and with the results I'm reaping from using it, it's really worth the reasonable cost. I'm Tinkled Pink, I discovered this existed. Since, I recommended it to my sister, I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone else! 😊"

Apply too thin of a layer, it becomes a flaky mess when it's time to peel it off the skin. Apply too thick of a layer, the mask takes forever to dry and my face ends up freezing cold in the meanwhile. I'd recommend patch testing it on the back of the hand to figure out how much product to apply. I think I got it now, but I have no idea how successful the peeling off part is going to be the next time I use this! It does leave my skin feels really soft and hydrated so it's worth the hassle in a way, but I am going to wait until it's much warmer to use up the rest of the product.

The thick consistency was easy to smear all over without it running away or being messy. I didn't itch or sting while the mask set for 25 minutes and I loved that there were no irritating fragrances. That would have deducted major stars for me. The mask peeled of very easily and the sensation felt really good. I was left with skin that felt soft and very moisturized without looking shiny or oily.

I heard from some co-workers that this was a brand worth trying - so I gave it a go. The product has a slight smell, but not unlike other skin products, and certainly not offensive.

To test this, I follow the directions, but only applied on/around my nose, so I could better compare immediate results. I definitely noticed a difference. While I wouldn't call this a blackhead mask, it definitely helped my skin look better.

I have a small USB microscope on order so that I can better measure the quality of the improvement. Overall, I am satisfied with the performance of this product, and will continue to use it."

It takes a minute to solidify a bit but once it does, you can move around and do what you need without worrying it'll drip or fall off like a clay mask or anything heavier so you can stay active and do what you need. You could also do nothing and relax which is what I'd recommend. Definitely do this in a decent layer and don't make it paper thin so it'll peel off easier. If you're wanting to save money by making it super thin, that's fine too. It'll dry faster and won't last as long and to remove it, just wash and rub your face rather than peeling it to make it easier"

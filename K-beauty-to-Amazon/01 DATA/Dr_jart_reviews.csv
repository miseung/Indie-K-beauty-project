It is moisturizing, has sunscreen and does a good job at covering the redness, so those points are great. But, the price point is what makes me give it 4 stars."

I have very red, dry, sensitive skin. I used to have severe acne so the hyperpigmentation is REAL- especially being fair skinned. I now use retin-a so it is even drier. I recommend applying when skin is still damp for best moisture. Highly recommend for those with redness issues who are tired of applying thick/heavy foundations. I get compliments on my skin all the time while only wearing this :) It is also good for your skin which you can't say about foundations. Buy it, the half size has lasted me over 4 months!"

I’ll keep with this product for sure!"

Well I saw a video of a gal that had very red skin she used this and it worked. So I was like SOLD well got it today and tried it out right away. To just be completely disappointed. It literally covers nothing, doesn’t even kind of lighten the redness. Didn’t cover my rosie cheeks, and didn’t even touch a reddish acne scar I have. It also has a very weird smell."

I found that it's helping to improve my skin, too. It may be expensive, but it's worth it. A little goes a long way."

It feels very heavy and sticky on the skin, which was not ideal for my older, mature skin and caused breakouts. The color correction feature primarily comes from the green tint titanium dioxide, which casts a white shadow on your face. Essentially, it’s a titanium dioxide sunscreen with added botanicals. Save your money and buy straight titanium dioxide and mix it with a green color corrector.
For the price point, it’s too expensive given the small quantity and the benefits it claims to deliver. However, it is a good sunscreen and does have a pleasant scent. Overall, it just wasn’t the right fit for me."

I also liked that it had SPF. Unfortunately, it made my very fair, neutral undertoned face look greasy and jaundiced. Maybe if you already have a golden undertone it'll work out for you, but I just looked shiny and sickly."

This CC cream does an excellent job of neutralizing redness and evening out my skin tone. The tiger grass (centella asiatica) is soothing and helps calm any irritation or inflammation on my skin.

The added SPF 30 is a great bonus, providing sun protection without feeling heavy or greasy. The cream has a light, pleasant scent and blends seamlessly into my skin, leaving a natural, dewy finish. It's perfect for those no-makeup days when I want my skin to look fresh and healthy.

Overall, this product has become a staple in my skincare routine. If you're looking for a color-correcting treatment that also offers skincare benefits, I highly recommend giving this one a try!"

I am a barber and I cut my hair weekly and shave regularly. I have sensitive skin and when I shave I experience a lot of redness for hours even after a cut/shave. I apply this stuff and it is instantly gone in seconds and lasts all day. The Cica also is proven to provide healing while the green cancels out the red color on your skintone. It is very small but the product is thick and feels like a paste, you want to get just a tiny amount and spot treat it on the red areas. I will continue using and I do recommend, but I do wish the price would either come down or give us more product for the high amount that it costs. All-in-all the product is great."

I'm a man that sometimes gets a pimple here or there. Occassionly I'll slip up and try to pop one and it gets all red and I don't want to leave my apartment. Take today for example, I tried to pop a pimple that had been bothering me but probably wasn't noticeable to other people. Oh well, just won't go out tonight. Well, this chick hit me up on Tinder and wants me to take her out tonight! Oh shoot... well I dabbed a little Dr. Jart on the red spot, and its not nearly as noticeable. Its still there, but it isn't BRIGHT RED anymore, its just slightly pink and blends in with my surrounding skin tone, its not super noticeable anymore and I don't feel embarassed about going out tonight. Its best to just not pick at things, but if you do, this product is a great fallback. Who knows, maybe I end up marrying this chick tonight. If I do we'll have to name our kid Doctor Jart."

I used it in a few areas that didn't have a lot of redness and later in the day, my face had a slightly greenish tint. If you get this, I would use in targeted places. I have very sensitive skin and it didn't seem to irritate my face, didn't seem to dry out my face, and make-up applied over it went on smoothly. Pat the product in and allow to fully soak in/dry before applying anything on top of it. Please keep in mind I have only used it once."

It it as greasy as Vaseline and doesn't stay where I put it. It gathers into wrinkles and creases where I didn't put it. Rosecea shines through no matter how thick I try to put it on, but it doesn't work like that. I do however think it might have a medicinal effect over time as the redness overall seems less after a night of wearing. But I definitely can't use during the day."

But the picture& video from the main page isn’t really true.( that’s why minus 1 star) Yes it does hide the imperfections and does a great job, but not to this level .You ll need to add thick coverage on top to make it look similar .
The bottle is tiny , but it looks like you don’t need much per use, which is nice.
Anyway, I’d still recommend it. I have acne scars and rosacea and so far this is the best solution when I need to be in public."

As someone with rosacea I always struggle with ways to combat redness. This cream has helped me do just that without having to cake on foundation or cover-up! It goes on green, but as you rub it into your skin the cream turns more beige/tan. I will say, this product works best if your skin is already hydrated/moisturized. If you have dry skin or don't put on moisturizer before applying, I imagine the blend would not be as easy. I typically wash my face, add a moisturizer, put on Dr. Jart, and continue with my makeup routine."

This product has been a life saver! Most foundations I’ve tried end up being too cakey or just don’t match my tone well enough and look unnatural.
This essentially takes the place of any foundation in my morning routine. I put it on shortly after moisturizing and it blends to look very natural. It feels like nothing on my skin and actually sets in pretty well to hold up good against sweat at times. I have found that it lasts usually all day without much issue (8 am - 10 pm for me), but can occasionally get dry spots. I have acne prone skin and have noticed small breakouts that could be from this product, but they are usually rare and could just be from something else in my routine.

Some tips:
Be careful not to put too much as it can make you too pale, I usually layer a little concealer on after and it helps even out the tone as well. Be aware that I would only recommend this to very pale skinned people, anyone with a little tint to their skin might find this looking VERY pale on them."

Here’s my thoughts and suggestions:

-It covers redness well but if you’re having a bad acne day, don’t depend on this entirely. You may need to partner it with concealer.
-Make sure your skin is hydrated before applying.
-You can use a damp beauty blender to apply.
-A little goes a long way.
-I apply moisturizer first, then the cream. If you’re feeling fancy, you can still powder your face and apply bronzer, blush, and highlighter.
-I don’t recommend using LIQUID bronzer/blush/highlighter on top of the cream. The cream will lift off when you try to blend them together.
-It covers freckles well, too. I like to take a q-tip and uncover mine, so that’s why you see them in my photo.
-It literally lasts the entire day. ALL DAY!
-I like to apply MAC fix it setting spray after I apply the cream and powder my face because it “melts” the cream, evens it out, and gives you a more healthy, natural look. It’s the only setting spray I’ve used that does this. Without it the cream you might look dry and patchy, even if you applied moisturizer first."

But now, almost two years later, I’ve found I use it more often than not! I have Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and my face flushes bright red very easily, especially after a long day of work, so I like wearing something to hide the red. I was a foundation user for a long time but since I’ve started using this, I’ve gradually stopped using foundation completely. I find that it sits and lasts better than even my favorite foundation. It took me a little while to find the right amount to use because if you use too much, it’s definitely not the right color. But this is truly a little-goes-a-long-way product and it corrects my redness just enough to look natural. I usually apply it after doing a full skincare routine because it sits best on moisturized skin. Because you truly don’t need a lot, it ends up being a very cost effective product in the long run. I bought my first bottle in December 2022 and now I can’t go back. I went for a smaller bottle this time just because of how long it lasts. I’ll wear it either on its own or sometimes I’ll put a light layer of powder on top to seal it, but with just a little bit of product it stays well for hours and looks very natural, at least in my case! Even if my skin isn’t flushed, I’ll use it to spot certain areas to even everything out. Great to have on hand and I never travel without it."

I got the small sample size instead of the huge one and it's definitely not a paste, it's a more like a moisturizing cream. And it's light weight and build able.

I permanently have rosy cheeks and I will use this every day and will probably upgrade to the bigger jar. I did my skincare of cleansing + moisturizing because I worried it would be pasty and but it was not.

I could definitely see running late and putting this on dry skin with no issues because it's consistency is that of a moisturizer.

That said for my desired look it took two applications. I think they reformulate cause it's thinner now, but still build able and light weight. I had one Lil red pimple (real small) and it was difficult to fully conceal... Ironically if it was more pastey it would probably gave worked lol.

That said my discoloration of my smooth skin from redness/other was totally gone!

I blended this on like I would a moisturizer and that didn’t cover the redness and then I dabbed it on again and pressed into my skin, and that still didn’t cover the redness, but it help d a bit. It might’ve taken the edge off the look of the redness, but it definitely doesn’t have enough green pigment to camouflage.

This product WORKS. I struggle with redness and mild rosacea on my cheeks and chin, and usually wear a decent amount of foundation to hide it.

This product is small and a tad pricey but worth the purchase! My mom was shocked at how it instantly neutralized my red skin in less than a minute after application. I put it on my left side to test it in case I had a reaction but I will be buying more from this company, to be sure!

The product has an earthy, herbal scent and a light oily feel to it. My skin feels soft and moisturized. This is a great product on days u don’t want to deal with heavy foundation."

Your skin is extremely hydrated. Moisturize the night before AND directly before applying.
2.) You have very light skin.

This product has eliminated my need for foundation! It feels much lighter and healthier for the skin than using primer + foundation + powder + setting spray. Now I just apply moisturizer and this product, and a little bit of powder to eliminate shine. (I have EXTREMELY oily skin, it always looks shiny no matter what products I use.) My skin has been EXTREMELY red for my entire life, and I would have to smother on a ton of foundation to hide it. This product covers it insanely well and I hardly need to use any. Sure, its expensive, but this tiny little jar will last me months of daily use."

The color correction feature primarily comes from the green tint titanium dioxide, which casts a white shadow on your face. Essentially, it’s a titanium dioxide sunscreen with added botanicals. Save your money and buy straight titanium dioxide and mix it with a green color corrector.
For the price point, it’s too expensive given the small quantity and the benefits it claims to deliver. However, it is a good sunscreen and does have a pleasant scent. Overall, it just wasn’t the right fit for me."

This product has been a life saver! Most foundations I’ve tried end up being too cakey or just don’t match my tone well enough and look unnatural.
This essentially takes the place of any foundation in my morning routine. I put it on shortly after moisturizing and it blends to look very natural. It feels like nothing on my skin and actually sets in pretty well to hold up good against sweat at times. I have found that it lasts usually all day without much issue (8 am - 10 pm for me), but can occasionally get dry spots. I have acne prone skin and have noticed small breakouts that could be from this product, but they are usually rare and could just be from something else in my routine.

Some tips:
Be careful not to put too much as it can make you too pale, I usually layer a little concealer on after and it helps even out the tone as well. Be aware that I would only recommend this to very pale skinned people, anyone with a little tint to their skin might find this looking VERY pale on them."

Here’s my thoughts and suggestions:

-It covers redness well but if you’re having a bad acne day, don’t depend on this entirely. You may need to partner it with concealer.
-Make sure your skin is hydrated before applying.
-You can use a damp beauty blender to apply.
-A little goes a long way.
-I apply moisturizer first, then the cream. If you’re feeling fancy, you can still powder your face and apply bronzer, blush, and highlighter.
-I don’t recommend using LIQUID bronzer/blush/highlighter on top of the cream. The cream will lift off when you try to blend them together.
-It covers freckles well, too. I like to take a q-tip and uncover mine, so that’s why you see them in my photo.
-It literally lasts the entire day. ALL DAY!
-I like to apply MAC fix it setting spray after I apply the cream and powder my face because it “melts” the cream, evens it out, and gives you a more healthy, natural look. It’s the only setting spray I’ve used that does this. Without it the cream you might look dry and patchy, even if you applied moisturizer first."

But now, almost two years later, I’ve found I use it more often than not! I have Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and my face flushes bright red very easily, especially after a long day of work, so I like wearing something to hide the red. I was a foundation user for a long time but since I’ve started using this, I’ve gradually stopped using foundation completely. I find that it sits and lasts better than even my favorite foundation. It took me a little while to find the right amount to use because if you use too much, it’s definitely not the right color. But this is truly a little-goes-a-long-way product and it corrects my redness just enough to look natural. I usually apply it after doing a full skincare routine because it sits best on moisturized skin. Because you truly don’t need a lot, it ends up being a very cost effective product in the long run. I bought my first bottle in December 2022 and now I can’t go back. I went for a smaller bottle this time just because of how long it lasts. I’ll wear it either on its own or sometimes I’ll put a light layer of powder on top to seal it, but with just a little bit of product it stays well for hours and looks very natural, at least in my case! Even if my skin isn’t flushed, I’ll use it to spot certain areas to even everything out. Great to have on hand and I never travel without it."

I got the small sample size instead of the huge one and it's definitely not a paste, it's a more like a moisturizing cream. And it's light weight and build able.

I permanently have rosy cheeks and I will use this every day and will probably upgrade to the bigger jar. I did my skincare of cleansing + moisturizing because I worried it would be pasty and but it was not.

I could definitely see running late and putting this on dry skin with no issues because it's consistency is that of a moisturizer.

That said for my desired look it took two applications. I think they reformulate cause it's thinner now, but still build able and light weight. I had one Lil red pimple (real small) and it was difficult to fully conceal... Ironically if it was more pastey it would probably gave worked lol.

That said my discoloration of my smooth skin from redness/other was totally gone!

The young lady on the social media video I saw is actually in the picture for the ad right here on Amazon and when she blended it in, her redness just disappeared. I know how color correctors work because I use a pink one under my eyes to color correct brown discoloration/dark circles and it completely cancels out the brown. I blended this on like I would a moisturizer and that didn’t cover the redness and then I dabbed it on again and pressed into my skin, and that still didn’t cover the redness, but it help d a bit. It might’ve taken the edge off the look of the redness, but it definitely doesn’t have enough green pigment to camouflage. I do like that it has 30SPF sunscreen in it and it does moisturize very well and I know it’s got great ingredients in it, so I will keep it and use it as extra protection for my cheeks where I have a lot of redness and scars that are still red from breakouts.

Your skin is extremely hydrated. Moisturize the night before AND directly before applying.
2.) You have very light skin.

This product has eliminated my need for foundation! It feels much lighter and healthier for the skin than using primer + foundation + powder + setting spray. Now I just apply moisturizer and this product, and a little bit of powder to eliminate shine. (I have EXTREMELY oily skin, it always looks shiny no matter what products I use.) My skin has been EXTREMELY red for my entire life, and I would have to smother on a ton of foundation to hide it. This product covers it insanely well and I hardly need to use any. Sure, its expensive, but this tiny little jar will last me months of daily use."

It's a pretty cool kind of mask, completely different from the usual drippy serum slathered thin cotton sheet masks. There's a foil packet with white goopy serum that I first dabbed all over my face, then spread out evenly with clean hands - it's not drippy at all, it's a very solid viscous goop lol. Then there's another sheet mask packet that has the rubber mask in it that was wet with another serum. The rubber mask kinda smells like the slimes that kids like to play with and the feel of it was like like thin and soft gelatin. There was already two small punctures in it just from taking it out of the packet and plastic sheet folded around it, so definitely very fragile. It felt very cool to the touch but quickly went away as my skin warmed it up. Chilled out for about 45 min and it got very cool again towards the last 15 minutes. However, once I took it off, there was still visible goo on my face. I tried rubbing it in and adding a moisturizer on top to seal it in, but it all just congealed into a sticky tacky residue that I couldn't stand after 20 minutes. I ended up rinsing off my face with water before applying my usual light and heavy moisturizers."

Unlike standard face mask the Dr.Jart+ Cryo Rubber Brightening Face Mask is two steps that has an ampoule that's a vitamin C serum. Unlike regular face mask where you apply for 20 minutes, this one recommends 30-40 mins in order to let the serum soak into your skin and really get the effects working.

The mask is occlusive so it basically forces the serum down into your skin instead of some of it evaporating. The mask is 30 to 40 minutes of wear so it’s great for while you’re in the bath or doing your hair before you do your makeup for a big night out. I’m not going to lie - the mask is two pieces and they do slip a little bit while you’re wearing it but you can easily readjust. The end result is a glowing complexion.

- It's been a half hour since taking it off, and my face still feels cool
- Once it finally all absorbed, my skin felt soft

Things I don't like about it:
- The instructions seem to say to use the entire gel pack all in one use, yet there is far too much for it to absorb into the skin. I had to wipe off most of it, instead of rubbing the excess in like the directions say.
- As far as I can tell, there's only one use per packet, yet the instructions say to use it about 3 times per week.
- My skin felt a bit itchy while using the mask.

This did leave my face feeling soft and refreshed, but I wouldn't want to use it regularly, because it's messy and wasteful if there's only one use per packet."

It is currently $16 and it seems you should be able to reuse the rubber mask from the instructions that say to use it 2-3x a week (even though you only get one packet of Vitamin C). I plan to keep this mask and use it again with my other skincare serums before bed. The Vitamin C was more a dense lotion which I generiously applied to my face and chest. The rubber mask came in 2 pieces and were each protected with plastic film. I like how the eyes and mouth cutouts were very generous (in the past with their regular white ""cloth like"" masks, I would rip the holes open a little more so none of the edges would touch my eyes or mouth area. The rubber mask provides a slight cool feeling which is nice right now in the summer. I wanted to check some emails while using the mask and it did get a bit loose and I almost decided to take it off and toss it but after taking both pieces off and reapplying a few times, it has stuck on.

I used the moisture mask (blue) and it gave my skin a nice boost of moisture and cooling. My face has been a little red lately because it has been really hot, this felt nice for my skin. It definitely cooled down my face. It does have a cooling sensation but not in a minty, menthol way, which is good because I'm not a fan of that. It had that cooling sensation in the beginning but starts to wear off after 10 minutes. I did also feel a tingling sensation, which I assume is just the serum working. The tingling sensation also went away after 15-20 minutes.

I was working on my laptop so I used this sitting up. The mask did slip down a little bit but surprisingly not as much as I thought it would. Don't touch or play with it too much otherwise it will start sliding down and falling off even more. The small packet of serum was just the right amount to cover my entire face. The rubber part was a bit too small to cover my entire face or perhaps I placed it incorrectly but I remember wishing it was a bit larger so it would cover more towards my forehead. I have a small face so I'm actually surprised, but like I said I probably placed it incorrectly. The rubber part of the mask helps the serum stay and soak into the skin. It was comfortable to wear. Handle the rubber portion with care because it will tear if you put too much force on it.

Once I removed the mask there was a lot of serum still visible on my face. I didn't try to rub it in, I just let it air dry. It does leave my face looking a bit greasy/dewy but I'm fine with it because I usually use masks at night before bed. My face definitely felt very moisturized and soft. I like Dr Jart masks but they are slightly pricier, although not ridiculous. Going forward I'll probably get more of these. As a busy mom of a toddler I don't always have the time to lay down and do a mask for 30-40 minutes but at least this one does work while I'm sitting up, although expect a little bit of slipping and sliding as well. Give this a try if your skin needs a major moisture boost and cooling down. This is one pack which means it is one use only. Made in Korea."

It does recommend doing it a bit more than what I'd say you really need to do but I think once or twice a month would be better. My skin really looked and felt amazing. it was glowing and smooth and soft. I recommend!!

Edit
I saw some reviews talking about how the mask itself isn't great or they don't like that step. The point of the ""rubber"" mask is to help the product soak into the skin deeper and penetrate it better. It isn't to just look funny or an unnecessary step. The mask itself also is made of sea moss and can be washed and reused with other products. That is one of my favorite parts of the mask!!"

The time is what kills this procedure, so if you don't have a lot of time, i would avoid using this. My skin does feel a lot cooler after 30 mins of application and have notice a reduction of redness. is it worth the price?

My skin was very hydrated afterwards & it did feel cool while I was using it but nothing else stood out in comparison to other masks that are quicker, easier and/or less expensive to use.
So while this was nice to use once, I wouldn't use this as a weekly regime because it's too time consuming and costly to use."

I love dr jart sheet masks and this one is by far their most expensive, without actually providing much improvement over their cheaper ones. My skin was definitely more glowy and even-toned, but it typically is when I use their masks and the effects were gone by the next day.

The mask itself is also very cool to the touch and feels really refreshing on the skin. I love that it comes in two parts and you can stretch it to fit your face perfectly. I've seen complaints that the mask rips easily but I only experienced that when my nails pierced it. It is a bit delicate so work carefully and patiently to stretch it.

You first use the little packet which is a creamy white consistency like lotion. You get surprisingly a lot in the packet so make sure you spread it evenly. The mask is folded up inside the bigger packaging in two separate pieces. Be gentle with the mask because it rips very easily. I poked a whole in my forehead and chin just from touching it with my nails and trying to put it back in place. It’s going to work best if you’re laying down or at an angle, because there’s so much liquid that it slides down your face when you’re using it. One random thing that I appreciated is that the mask packaging is paper/foil so when your hands are slimy from the hylauranic acid, you can still easily open the mask.

Korean skincare is awesome, and I could definitely tell my face was more moisturized and soft after using it and even the next day.

Now it says you should use one of these every 2-3 days but at $20 a piece that’s going to be pretty expensive. I do think this is a good monthly mask though to refresh your face."

The mask is slightly on the thinner side, which makes it feel light and comfortable on the skin. However, this does mean that it can be a bit tricky to unfold without tearing if you're not careful.

**Formula & Performance:**
Infused with a powerful blend of niacinamide, glutathione, and a variety of plant extracts, the mask targets dullness and uneven skin tone effectively. After a 15-20 minute application, the skin feels instantly hydrated and looks visibly brighter. The serum absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky residue, which is a plus for those who prefer not to rinse off after using sheet masks.

**Results:**
The brightening effect is noticeable immediately after use, with a more even skin tone and a healthy glow. While the results are not permanent, regular use of this mask can help maintain a luminous complexion. It's particularly useful before special occasions when you need a quick skin pick-me-up.

**Pros:**
- Instantly brightens and evens out skin tone
- Hydrates the skin deeply
- Non-sticky formula
- Fits well and feels comfortable on the skin

**Cons:**
- The thin material can tear if not handled gently
- The brightening effect is temporary and needs regular use for sustained results"

Now, this has a mesh, plastic backer. Unfold and pull this off before applying. You will be impressed that this isn't the typical thin serum. Instead this is a thicker cream. This is the first mask I have ever tried that is like this!

This applies easily, absolutely does not drip, and does not sting or burn in any way. I wore this for over twenty minutes. When I removed it, I really rubbed the leftover serum into my neck and the backs of my hands. Do not rinse, but allow this to just continue to work on your skin.

I was really impressed with how luminous my skin looked the next morning. So smooth!

After using this mask and applying the remaining serum (plenty for face, neck, and chest!), I definitely did notice a brightening effect immediately. My skin can sometimes be sensitive and this did not cause any negative reaction for me. The brightening effects only last maybe a day so you would need to incorporate this into your routine or just have it on hand for days where you want your skin to look extra nice. I'd definitely recommend for the latter use, as using it consistently would add up in price but only using for special occasions is much more reasonable!"

I like that the fit is quite good, the holes for the eyes, nose, and mouth fit well for me, though it doesn't go up high enough on my forehead. I just used some extra serum there. The serum itself is a milky substance that seems thick, though I'm not sure if that's because it was in the fridge or not. I was a bit annoyed the mask kept lifting from my chin under my lip, but it didn't lift anywhere else at all. Though it felt warm, the serum and mask against my face ere very soft feeling and nice, and I didn't notice any stinging or tingling at all.

I kept it on for the full 20 minutes and there was plenty of serum left to pat in.

My skin is sensitive and I found there was no irritation. It's easy to place on, wear, and to come off. The mask was gentle on my skin, and after removal I leave it to absorb. My skin felt softened after wearing this and soothed. I can't say I saw a big difference in fine lines, but I don't have many yet. My forehead appeared a little smoother, but otherwise I think this might require multiple applications. It felt very soothing to wear and I would definitely use this again!"

Well, the top section stayed put for the 40 minutes that this mask is supposed to be worn, but the bottom half slid off my face multiple times, which was annoying. The bottom piece also felt dried out after only a few minutes. My skin DID feel very plump and hydrated after use, but it definitely didn't ""smooth"" any wrinkles. The ceramide moisture mask (yellow packaging) is the same price, and I feel like it had better results - and it stayed on my face better AND only needs to be worn for 20 minutes, so I recommend that one instead."

I have very sensitive skin and have had bad reactions to many products, but this mask is particularly gentle, and just as advertised, wonderful for my middle aged overworked skin.

So, first, this arrives nicely sealed but is also easy to open (just tear at the premade notches). Now, this is a two-part gel mask. Each part has double backers (one on front and one on back) So, take your time to peel those off. Apply the top and bottom mask and slide them into the perfect place. Once they are positioned, they stay. And, there is not one ounce of dripping!

I left this on until it was virtually dry. And, when I removed the two parts, my skin looked stunning! Well worth the time and investment.

But it's just one of those sheet masks. This just happens to be more rubbery than the regular kind, and on the packaging it mentions re-using it, so you could probably rinse it off, save it, and then get more serum to use with it. But this one is a firming one. Generally after using these I don't really see any immediate results, they just feel fancy and nice to use. The serum absorbs easily and rubs in, and the mask makes it so you have to take a break from things. So these are fun to get for that aspect."

I love that the ampoule comes separate from the rubbery mask, because it always annoyed me how in the pre-soaked masks, 50% of the serum got left behind in the packet.

This mask really is COOLING. It feels amazing! You will look ridiculous with it on, but isn't that half the fun? I have pale, very reactive/dramatic skin, so I have to be cautious about what I use for skincare. I have some psoriasis on my face as well, and am prone to periorbital dermatitis. This did not cause any sensitivity issues, irritation or flare ups.

My skin was left feeling really refreshed, calm, soothed, etc. And I noticed a decrease in redness/reactivity of my skin for a few days afterwards, and my skin just seeemed happier, plumper and more even.

I really enjoyed using this mask, although I do believe it is a bit on the pricey side. I really did see results, though, so that puts it far ahead 98% of the other face masks I have tried- so I do think I would get this again."

The price for just a single face mask made me hesitant but this mask is worth the price. This face mask has a 2 step treatment. It comes with an ampoule filled with serum that you apply to your face and then you place the rubber mask on top. One thing to keep in mind is that you’re supposed to leave this face mask on for 30-40 minutes versus the 20 min or so with typical face masks. If you’re okay with the higher price tag and longer time requirement this mask is worth it. My skin was noticeably softer and moisturized afterwards.

In the past, I've used a few of their creams and masks but didn't try this rubber kind yet. It is certainly pricey but if you think about a facial, it is still way more affordable. I like how the product is in a separate step from the mask. Typically when they are together, you have a lot of product wasted in the package / it can start to dry out and evaporate. The ampoule potion is very soothing and rich. Once you apply the mask, you can do what you normally do, but just more carefully. I was able to drink my tea and that is not something I can usually do with the white clothlike masks that you typically get. The mask did start to kind of fall off my face but taking both pieces off and doing the bottom one first was the key to making it stay again. It seems you can reuse the mask a few times, so I plan to use my own serums and then putting the rubber mask over it a few times before I toss this."

Immediately after using this mask, I noticed the redness on my face improved a ton and my skin definitely looked more plump and hydrated. Try not to talk or move your face too much with this mask on!

- The mask felt like it was drying out a little too fast for what I wanted at the 7-10 minute mark. Perhaps that was because of my skin type?"

I have oily skin but in my mid-thirties I haven't had issues with acne for over a decade so this isn't exactly targeted for me.

The packaging is quite nice, the little pump doesn't dispense too much and you don't need much for it to be effective. Note: the packaging recommends 2-3 drops, which I think could be mistaken for pumps, but you don't need more than one pump.

The clear formula doesn't really foam that much, for something advertised that way. It does have a strong tea tree smell, which people will either like or hate. I think it's alright, not my personal favorite.

It leaves my skin feeling clean, soft and not stripped which is good for this kind of thing. Dehydration is a huge issue for people treating acne, back when I was a teen all the products seemed designed to dry the crap out of your skin with the idea of ""drying"" the acne out. I'm glad to see more of a focus on gentle cleansing, PH balancing and barrier repair now.

While this isn't targeting my specific issues, and it hasn't changed the oiliness of my face throughout the day, I think it's a nice formula and would be great for someone struggling with acne. It is a little pricey for the size of the product when there are many good K-beauty cleansers out there."

However, I found this to be a bit more than I need. When you get tea tree products, you never know how tea tree forward they will be, and this smells really tea tree forward to me (the scent also lingers).

The scent is much too strong for me to enjoy, but those who enjoy products that are tea tree forward will like this, and it has a lot of soothing botanicals and ceramide to help heal skin.

Note that this has isopropyl alcohol in it, but it's low on the ingredient list. Alcohol not only functions as a solvent (helpful for botanical extracts), but it also has preservative functions, and indeed this product seems gently preserved.

It has a strong tea tree scent. The actual product is a thick gel that foams up when you lather it. The bottle is much smaller than the cardboard packaging, but it should last awhile at 4oz of product. It comes with a pump top.

The first time I used it, I used one entire pump of product. Let me tell you - that is way, way too much. You truly only need a little bit! The next time, I used just a small partial pump and it was better. Neither time did the cleanser ""foam"". The scent is pretty strong of tea tree oil, very much like eucalyptus. I personally find the smell invigorating, but if you're scent sensitive, I'd give this a pass.

As far as the cleansing goes, I didn't find it drying at all. My face felt clean and perhaps lightly exfoliated. I had a breakout or two starting and they didn't get worse after using this - if anything they got better (but I can't say it was the direct result of using this product because I have other things I'm doing in tandem re the breakouts).

I think this is a nice product. I wish the pump on the bottle wasn't so strong because I used maybe a week or two of product the first time! I'm also not sure about the ""foam"". I'll continue to use this to prevent full breakouts!"

This is just me because I seem to have a mild allergy so this will probably work well for most, but just be aware that this isn't guaranteed to be perfectly gentle on sensitive skin--like with any product, do a little patch test first to make sure it agrees with your skin.

Tea tree oil is something I am very familiar with since I used to wash my face with tea tree soap when I was a teenager, of course back then we just called it ""green soap"".

Since I love the clean and clinical smell of tea tree but not the drying effects, I'd hoped there would be enough other ingredients in this cleanser to balance it out.

It really only takes a couple drops of the cleanser and a bit of water to get my face thoroughly clean. This cleanser does smell strongly of tea tree, just an FYI. It rinses off very easily and left my skin feeling squeaky clean but not particularly moisturized at all.

Other than the tea tree oil this cleansing foam also contains salicylic acid, witch hazel and camphor. My dry, sensitive skin is cringing. But wait! This cleanser also contains Allantoin, niacinamide, centella, ceramide NP and plenty of plant arrived extracts and oils. That is a lot of very nice hydrating, repairing and protecting ingredients.

Unfortunately, with the salicylic acid, witch hazel and camphor, this cleanser is not for my skin, but gosh I wish I had it when my skin was oilier and prone to breakouts. Overall I think it's a great formulation but likely meant for younger faces.

At the time of this review, Teatreement Cleansing Foam is selling for $29. It looks to be a well-balanced formulation for oily complexions and I think it is a good value, especially considering it's a good size bottle at 4 oz."

This cleanser is part of the popular Cicapair line, which is known for its soothing properties, particularly due to the inclusion of Centella Asiatica, or Cica, a key ingredient celebrated for its calming and healing benefits.

The cleanser comes out as a light, airy foam that feels soft and soothing on the skin. It effectively removes impurities, excess oil, and makeup without stripping the skin of its natural moisture. This is particularly important for sensitive skin types, which can easily become irritated or dry with harsh cleansers.

One of the standout features of this face wash is its calming effect. The Centella Asiatica extract works wonders in reducing redness and soothing inflammation, making it a great choice for those dealing with irritation or rosacea. The formula is also free from harsh chemicals and artificial fragrances, which further minimizes the risk of irritation.

In terms of usage, the foaming action provides a refreshing and thorough cleanse, leaving the skin feeling clean and balanced. It's suitable for daily use and works well as part of a gentle skincare routine. The packaging is practical, with a pump dispenser that makes it easy to use and control the amount of product.

Overall, the Dr.Jart+ Cicapair Foaming Face Wash Cleanser is a fantastic choice for anyone seeking a gentle, calming cleanser that effectively cleanses without causing irritation. Its soothing properties and gentle formula make it ideal for sensitive skin, and it provides a refreshing, comfortable cleansing experience. While it might be a bit more expensive than some other cleansers on the market, the benefits it offers for sensitive and redness-prone skin make it well worth the investment."

I've seen this brand at Sephora but haven't given it a try until now.

This cleanser comes in a sleek, pump-dispenser bottle that feels luxurious in the shower. A single pump dispenses a generous amount of creamy lather that feels soft and soothing on the skin. There's a faint herbal scent that I found pleasant and not overpowering.

Does it cleanse? Absolutely. This cleanser does a great job of removing everyday dirt and oil without leaving my skin feeling stripped or dry. My skin feels clean and refreshed after washing, but not tight or uncomfortable. For me, it's perfect for my morning cleanse or as a second cleanse after removing makeup with an oil cleanser. I note second cleanse because this product won't actually clean your face thoroughly if you've got on a full face of makeup or layered up with serums, etc.

The cica ingredient, which is supposed to soothe and calm irritation, is a nice touch for sensitive skin. I haven't experienced any breakouts or redness while using this cleanser, and my skin overall feels calmer and more balanced."

I generally like Dr. Jart products and in all honesty love most K-beauty products so this review may be biased. The cleanser is foaming. I must agree I didn't use as much as the model in the product listing used in that video - at that rate, I could wash 3 faces! I also used it right after an oil cleansing so mine didn't necessarily foam but more emulsified and cleaned my skin off the melted makeup and oil. I've never found a cleanser that made me ksip moisturizing so I did follow up with a serum and moisturizer afterwards. Overall good product but about 2x as pricey as some other K beauty brands."

- I know this sounds weird but just by looking at its packaging, it feels like they really know when they are doing and its the best packaging they could possibly do. It feels very responsible and intention so 5/5 for that.
- Even though its all liquid, its not hard to handle, it rubs quickly into the skin and dries fast.
- After weeks of testing this out, I don't see a huge difference in my pores, they are still the same but I have noticed a slight ""evening"" of the skin, I have some parts on my face that are darker than the others but I feel like is a degree more even.

It comes in a square green glass bottle with a pump. You do have to shake the liquid to mix it up before dispensing. The instructions say to use 2-3 pumps on your face, which is about enough. I've owned Dr. Jart products before and like them, but my one criticism of this is that being such a thin liquid, it's hard to apply because it tends to leak between your fingers before you can get your cupped hand onto your face. It's probably most advisable to use a cotton round. I can't tell yet whether this is helping to exfoliate my face."

This product actually has been very easy on my skin and hasn't given me any discomfort or irritation, which is a big plus. This serum is light and has the consistency of water. It's very thin and light and easy to apply to the skin.

Getting older I can see more of my pores - they are visible and some seem like craters. I also tend to get blackheads around my nose that are pesky and hard for me to get rid of. I usually take what products say they will do with a grain of salt because in my experience, they don't work as stated they should. But from my use of this product I can visibly notice a difference in most of my larger pores. These pores have decreased in size to where some aren't even noticeable anymore. This has greatly improved the way my skin looks, at least to me anyway. And my blackheads? Well, they haven't totally disappeared but there's defiantly not as many around my nose area.

So far I've been liking the results from using this product but it is expensive for only slightly over one ounce of product. I do see this product lasting me for quite some time seeing how I only use a little at a time but at the current price I couldn't see myself purchasing this on a monthly or even bi-monthly basis. Time will tell how long this actually lasts me but if it would last a few months at a time then it might be something I would realistically use and purchase on a regular basis."

I have dry-ish mature skin with oily pores. I’ve used clay masks quite a few times- I have a tub of clay powder that I mix, usually with apple cider vinegar. I don’t do this nearly as often as my skin would like because it’s a mess- the bowl, the sink, the face cloth all need to be cleaned of green mud. I also don’t like the hardened mask because it aggravates my TMJD pain. Basically I love the effects of clay masks but hate doing them.
This clay sheet mask is brilliant. It is easy to apply and left no mess to clean up. I also loved that it didn’t leave a layer of dried mud on my face that I had to soften and scrub off- it left only a tiny bit of a residue that easily wiped clean.
More about the sheet mask: I didn’t detect any fragrance. The coverage of the mask was very good but I wish that it wrapped just under the edge of my chin a little bit. It also didn’t have 100% coverage on the sides of my nose but I was able to manipulate the mask to cover most of the gap after peeling off the top layer. It was super comfortable to wear and stayed fairly flexible, never cracking. The mask stayed on well. It peeled off very easily and the light residue wiped off with a clean cloth. My skin was left feeling a little tighter (in a good way) but not overly dry.
Overall the ease of this mask is 5 out of 5. However I don’t think that it was quite as effective as a traditional clay mask- it didn’t seem to draw out as much probably because it didn’t cover the face as thickly and didn’t dry completely. Though more than I would normally spend on a single face mask, I think that the price is fairly reasonable for the quality and ease of this mask- premium ingredient face masks are not cheap."

The whole point of using clay is to get in contact with the skin so that it can work on drawing out the impurities. By putting clay in the cloth mask it stuck to the fabric more than my skin. The instructions were also a bit confusing. The mask comes in two pieces but is backed on both sides. It said to remove the white back and apply then remove the clear top piece. What it didn't say is that you should do each half one at a time. I took off the white backs and positioned the sheets but then they overlapped making it difficult to get the clear top off the bottom piece. It caused the mask to stretch out some so the already very thin piece between the nose and lips was pretty much gone. It claims to be designed to stick better to problem areas like your nose but that is where it worked the worst. My cheek and forehead skin felt smoother after using but the rest of my face didn't feel like it even came in contact with it. This mask was such a mess and so much hassle. There are so many options out there. I don't plan on revisiting this one. I don't think clay and sheet masks play well together.

I think a jarred mud mask that you can apply precisely as a cream at the thickness you prefer, allow to dry, and wash away offers better value. What this mask offers is the novelty factor of peeling away the material with the hope of seeing pore filaments or blackheads pull out. I did NOT experience that, BTW - this did not work like a pore strip for me. It does de-oilify somewhat, but don't get excited about this as a pore clearer. It does a little light tightening but any mud mask will do that. I also don't think it really suits a sensitive skin, despite what the product photos suggest. This left my skin rather red.

The listing doesn't say otherwise and purchasing this brand at any other retail beauty store also only provides one mask at this price point. Some reviewers... I tell you... Anyway, I can't swear up and down this works because most skincare takes more than one use. However, I can say this felt nice on and my skin felt refreshed after using it. My pores at least for a few hours did seem visibly tighter. I also think it's a pretty unique mask because while I've used plenty of sheet masks in my day, I never saw a clay based one. To be honest, I think I prefer non-sheet masks, but that is a personal preference. I appreciate that this is fragrance-free too. I agree this isn't a very good value for a one-time use product, however, some people aren't concerned with budgets and at least upon first impressions it seems to do what it claims. This is a higher end brand and doesn't claim to be a budget friendly one, so if that isn't a concern to you, go for it. You might like the unique delivery."

It's kind of nice that it's 2 pieces instead of one (there's a top and a bottom), because it's easier to adjust. I think I have a shorter face, so sheet masks normally are too long for my face and fit weird.
It felt nice and tingly while I was wearing it, and it stayed on better than sheet masks usually do, which was nice. My skin afterwards felt soft.

Cons:
It has plastic on both sides, which made it kind of a pain to peel, stick on, and then try to peel off the other side while it's on your face. It was slightly less messy than a regular clay mask, but I still had to rinse my face afterwards. It felt like a gimmick, a clay mask trying to be a sheet mask, and I just don't think it was worth the effort.

I don't regret it, but I wouldn't pay more than $3 for it."

I left my mask on for the 15 minutes as directions stated and then rinsed it off. I loved how my complexion looked and felt after this process. The pores on my face looked cleaner therefore less noticeable and the ruddy redness of my complexion was more toned down and a lot of the redness disappeared for the day so I did not need to apply foundation.

This mask is very hydrating, yet not greasy, and does not irritate my sensitive skin (I cannot detect any fragrance), although due to the hyaluronic acid, my skin does tingle a bit when initially applying.

During the colder months, when my skin is much more dry, I'd like to use this nightly. For extra hydration during those months, I will often layer two different night creams as my last skincare step at night, so I think this would be an excellent last step even over night cream when your skin is extra dry, or if your skin is just moderately dry, this mask would be excellent used as a night cream.

It’s lightweight and has more of a gel-like consistency. It does take some time to absorb, but not nearly as much as others (maybe 15-20 minutes, which is good because I hate having sticky skin on a pillow case!). There’s a light scent that I’m not particularly fond of, but it’s very faint and not a dealbreaker by any means. You’re supposed to wash it off the next morning, but it doesn’t really feel like there’s much left. My skin isn’t super dry and this provides the perfect amount of extra hydration. If your skin is very dry, this might not be strong enough. Overall a nice overnight mask and worth the cost!"

Pros:
✅ After about 1 month, I can attest that it does smooth/hydrate and soften the skin by morning. Overall, the skin is dewy and well-hydrated.
✅ Checked ingredients, nothing toxic and no parabens!

Cons:
❌ The reason why I HATE this overnight mask is because it will adhere my face to my pillowcase (not like glue, but like an old glue stick). Even after reading for over 1 hour and waiting for it to ""absorb"", I will stick to my pillows. I've NEVER had this issue with any night mask and it's very annoying as a side sleeper."

It contains hyaluronic acid, panthenol, and Pentavitin, which provide unbeatable hydration.
Hyaluronic acid attracts and retains water and forms a hydrating layer.
Pentavitin binds to the skins’ keratin and provides 72-hour moisture so it doesn’t just rinse off.
Panthenol (pro-vitamin B5) also attracts water and is good for wound healing and skin repair.
Together, this is a lot of moisture for the skin!!
It comes in a sealed box and expires October 2026 if unopened and 12 months after opening.
It’s unscented and has a gel-cream consistency. Absorption is fast, less than 15 seconds. It feels a little tacky because of the barrier-protection ingredients so wearing this at night makes sense.
I apply it after cleansing, toning, and using a retinol serum.
In the morning my skin feels sooo soft and bouncy and looks plumper. At 50 years-old this is exactly what I want!
This is one of those products that can provide very quick results in appearances because of the way it draws in moisture. There aren’t really many longer-term age-fighting ingredients so I will make sure to use this in conjunction with retinol, peptides, niacinamide, and amino acids.
This is a good one to try, especially if you have parched skin!"

I ordered the product based on the manufacturer's claims in the ad, but the website did not list the full ingredients, which made it difficult to make an educated purchase. Other reviews have since shown images of the box with the full ingredients, which the manufacturer should have been transparent about from the start, given the price of the product.

The cosmetics industry has very few regulations, so manufacturers can make unverified claims about their products to attract consumers. It's a 'buyer-beware' industry and essential for buyers to educate themselves in the world of cosmetics and skincare.

Additionally, I'm concerned about the ""jar packaging"" of the product, as it exposes any beneficial ingredients to air and light, leading to their deterioration and potential contamination. Skincare products containing antioxidants and vitamins should be in airless, opaque, pump bottles or tubes to protect them from air, light, and bacteria."

I like how it sinks easily into the skin and it felt more like a water cream to me than an overnight mask, so it seems like it could be used during the daytime as well. I don't find it to have any particular scent either.

I’ve generally preferred Korean skin care and cosmetics because I think they do a better job of not stripping the skin barrier. This sleep mask has a light green, gel cream consistency, that goes on with a smooth, cooling effect.
It’s mostly unscented, but I feel like it has a very light balsa wood smell. I didn’t mind it. While the mask initially absorbed into the skin, I felt like it did leave a layer or film on the surface of my face that would probably be rubbed off by my pillow. The thing that I love the most is that this mask contains cica, from which I’ve read has great benefits and is especially gentle for aging or sensitive skin. I do think this mask would be better for people with skin on the dry side, or in the winter if you have oily or combination skin."

It's super refreshing when it's on the skin. I found that it is easy to put on, it is nice and thick and stays on the face. I felt skin become softer and feel smoother. I am very happy with this. I do not use this as a sleeping mask, because I don't want to get it everywhere. Despite the nice texture it will get all over everything. I put this on and keep it on between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on how much time I have. I don't think this is the best, I have some other skin concerns that I was hoping this would help and it doesn't but I still appreciate the softness and refreshing feeling.

Call me skeptical. I was certain the mask would rub off during the night, but since one applies so little of the product - a pea-sized amount is sufficient to fully cover the face - the product sinks into the skin really quickly. (That said, my guess is if one uses too much, it will rub off; the skin can only absorbs so much). In the AM I could still pleasantly feel the mask on my face and what was left rinsed off with water. My skin felt great after use. The jar is a good size and since so little is used per application it will last a long time. For the amount of product I think the price is fair."

Of course I always start by washing my face, but this step takes that cleaning aspect a little bit further. Meanwhile, it also hydrates and conditions the skin. Having mature combination skin, I love being able to clean deeper inside of those pores to ensure they are fully cleaned of impurities and excess sebum. Yet, this mask also hydrates and conditions to prepare it for the rest of my skincare regimen.

Once the mask is removed, you can see the extra moisturization. More damp than any sort of emollient layering, but it does add a light and clean layer to get you started. Do let that sit for several minutes to allow it to air dry. Then continue with the rest of your skincare routine. It does leave the skin a slight bit tacky, but don't worry about that because as soon as you add your other skincare products, that tackiness will completely go away. It provides you with a good, healthy start to a good day of a nice looking complexion.

Good for all skin types. Especially for those who need to be careful about ensuring clean and balanced pores. Works well for all adult age groups and is just has helpful for men as it is for women."

I feel like this is the type of treatment you get at a spa with results similar to a facial from one if not better. This mask is fully saturated with serum, so much so it's literally dripping with it. When you apply it to your face, it has a cooling feeling, but after a few minutes it begins to bubble up and feel hot like a bit of burning. The mask stays on 15-20 minutes, after which you can rub the remaining serum into your skin. It does make my face feel a little stiff almost like how your face feels when it's dry (except it's totally not dry!), so I do add a moisturizer cream on after as well. This mask works great and leaves your skin with a nice healthy glow :)."

Opening the mask from the packet they are completely drenched in product, so much so that even after you take out the mask there is so much product left inside that you could cover your whole face with it plus more at a later date. But that amount of product on the masks also makes them a bit difficult to open up because they are all like crumpled up in the packet, It took me a good 2 minutes to untangle the mask and get it open, and even then I didn’t realize there was a nose piece I hadn’t unfolded at first as you can see in the photos. I was wondering why a pore decongesting mask didn’t have a nose part! Haha. But I would much rather there be a lot of extra product than not enough, especially considering how expensive they are.

When you have it on it’s supposed to kind of bubble up, and it does a little towards the end of the 15-20 min, but not as much as I was expecting. It doesn’t burn or irritate my skin when I have it on, but you can feel that it’s a little bubbly, almost like what your skin feels like if you spill sparkling water or soda on it.

Once the time is up you take it off and then pat in the rest of the solution on your face and let it absorb. Now I’m really particular about what I put on my skin because I want it to feel nice. I don’t like when things are like oily or weird feeling on my face. And sadly this leaves this film on your skin and dries down stiff, so your face feels like you just let glue dry on it even an hour after you take the mask off. It’s also still tacky as well which I dislike. Now my skin did look nicer after, but I couldn’t handle the feel for more than an hour and had to rinse it off. So just be mindful that if your like me and don’t like that kind of consistency on your face that you will likely not like this.

All in all it’s not bad. I will definitely use these because I can see a slight difference after I use them, but I also don’t think I would repurchase them after they run out if im being honest."

I normally pat down excess serum after using face masks but this was the first mask I had to thoroughly wash off due to the smell/ how it felt on my face.

This Korean skin care company has been around for 20 years and they are a trusted brand to me. Dermask Porecting Solution Face Mask is formulated for oily skin mainly to purify pores. My skin is mature, but I still have an oilier T zone where pores can get congested. I found this sheet mask a bit overly goopy but that does make it easier to adhere to your face. It’s a good idea to do this over your sink so you don’t drip it onto your clothing. It took a while for me to feel the bubbling action. I wouldn’t say it sudsed a lot, but next time I will try massaging it more to generate more bubbles. I did feel slight tingling that was relaxing for the 15 minutes I kept it on. Quite a bit of product remained on my skin after. After 15 minutes, I gently blotted with a clean face towel. Because I used it at night, I was sure to hit the dryer areas of my face with a moisturizer afterwards. The next morning, my pores looked visibly smaller and purified.

I really like the packaging of this kit. Five individually sealed masks are contained in a 5-pack. That pack is also safety sealed, so if you wished to gift a pack to someone, it is trustworthy looking! I like the idea of using this mask for myself periodically in winter when I wear more makeup that can congest pores. If I were younger, I would use this product weekly to control breakouts. I find this pack of 15 a good value because these are usually $10 per mask when sold individually. Recommend this mask for oily skin or for spot treating oily areas and enlarged pores."

It’s basically a cream infused material that you lay on your face. It feels cool while you have it on your face. It comes in two pieces … one for the upper face including eyes and nose and the second for the lower face, mouth and chin. It’s easy to apply to the face and you can smooth out the wrinkles to get better coverage.

When I removed it, my face was still covered in cream. The instructions indicate that you should pat it to be absorbed. I haven’t washed my face but it’s been several hours and it hasn’t really completely absorbed. While I liked it on my face initially and basically found it gentle and unscented, I now feel a real urgency to wash my face and my eyes feel irritated by it even though I got nothing in them. I think the best idea is to leave it on for a bit and then rinse off what remains … of course, your experience might be different. I would love to try the other ones. I think the mud mask looks interesting.

It came with a single mask and is fun to use though not inexpensive. I don’t expect it to have a long lasting impact."

The reason is that this face mask is slightly thicker than your usual face mask since they use a different fabric that is more absorbent and stays saturated for a longer time than your traditional face masks. This face mask does come in 2 separate pieces so you do have to spend the extra time to try to fit the 2 pieces together onto your face like a puzzle. As someone with really dry and sensitive skin, I find that this mask is perfect for my needs and really does help keep my skin feeling more moisturized for a longer period of time."

It was easy to put it on, i have a small face, and i the holes aligned just fine, which i have problems with in some masks. It’s a 2 part mask, making for a better fit.

My skin felt lovely and soft. Hydrated. Really nice texture. It didn’t make my wrinkles go away, which i never expect them to do anymore, but moisturization was good, and i love that when i touch it, I’m not ending up with serum all over.

First things first - the bad: the expiration date on this was only one year out. Other masks we usually get are 2-3 years out for expiration dates, so these are relatively short.

The mask is divided into two parts instead of a single mask. You have an upper part that is upper cheeks, nose and forehead, and a lower part that is lower cheeks and chin. The serum or whatever is not super wet or sloppy on the surface of the mask material like it is with some other masks, and the mask material is a little thicker than usual. But in the end, it did the job just fine. Skin felt softer and looked great. I'd call that a success that would be five star if not for the short expiration dates."

This Korean skincare brand has created a unique moisturizer that addresses excess oil production and provides a refreshing hydration experience. Here's an honest review of my experience:

Oil Control and Hydration:
One of the standout features of this face moisturizer is its ability to control excess oil production while providing lightweight hydration. The formula, enriched with Niacinamide and Glycerin, helps regulate sebum secretion, leaving the skin feeling refreshed and balanced. My skin tends to get shiny throughout the day, and this moisturizer has helped keep the oiliness at bay, resulting in a more matte and even complexion.

Soothing and Calming:
The formula is infused with tea tree leaf extract, a powerful natural ingredient known for its soothing and calming properties. It helps reduce skin irritation and inflammation, providing relief to stressed complexions. My skin felt comforted and relaxed, especially during periods of sensitivity and reactivity.

Niacinamide's Benefits:
Niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3, offers a range of skin-enhancing benefits. It helps refine the appearance of enlarged pores, improves skin texture, and promotes a more even skin tone. With regular use, I noticed a visible improvement in the overall appearance of my pores and a more radiant complexion.

Lightweight and Quick-Absorbing:
The moisturizer has a lightweight and fluid texture, absorbing quickly into the skin. It provides an instant cooling sensation without leaving any greasy or sticky residue. My skin felt refreshed and revitalized, with no heavy or oily sensation often associated with richer creams.

Suitable for Sensitive Skin:
As a K-beauty enthusiast with sensitive skin, I appreciate that this moisturizer is carefully formulated to be gentle and non-irritating. Free from potential irritants like parabens and fragrances, it ensures a safe and soothing experience for even the most delicate complexions.

Overall Complexion Enhancement:
Not only does this moisturizer address oil control, but it also enhances the overall appearance of the skin. My skin looked healthier and more radiant, with a noticeable improvement in texture and tone. It provided an excellent base for makeup application, creating a smooth and even canvas.

Overall Recommendation:
As a K-beauty enthusiast, I highly recommend the Dr.Jart+ Teatreement Face Moisturizer to anyone seeking a balancing and hydrating solution for oily skin. The formula's tea tree leaf extract, Niacinamide, and lightweight hydration make it a refreshing and effective choice for combating excess oil production."

It's a very fluid, elegant lotion textured sunscreen that blends into the skin well. I'm oily and at first it looked a bit too dewy and glowy for my liking but it settles down to a more natural finish. I still think it would be better for drier skin but for how dry this summer has been, my skin is enjoying it. I haven't used it under makeup yet but alone it reapplies well without any pilling and doesn't feel heavy. Depending on how much sun I'm getting and reapplications, the dewier it tends to get and the oilier/shinier I look which isn't my favorite. If I'm spending most of the day inside and put this on once, it makes my skin look soft and healthy. I was hoping to use this on full sun, beach/pool days and this isn't water resistant either. For the price and how often you need to be diligent with spf, I can't see myself spending this much on one sunscreen. I'd recommend it for normal to dry skin, if it's in your budget!"

So when I had the opportunity to evaluate this sunscreen, I jumped at it. I wear sunscreen of 50 or more SPF pretty much every day. I have extremely sensitive skin, rosacea, and other issues due to chronic illness. I did not burn as a child but as I've gotten older, I am more susceptible to burning. A reliable sunscreen is a must for me. That said, I'm not too sure how I feel about this one. The second I put it on, my skin burned. Not outrageously, but it was definitely irritating. I did not break out or have any other reaction other than the burning, and that went away fairly quickly. I'm a little concerned that the recommendation for face and hands is a dime-sized amount. When you put on a conventional sunscreen, they recommend a shot glass size, which is much bigger. Sunscreen isn't the kind of thing you should skimp on. That said, it does seem like a little goes a long way, which would be fine for a regular moisturizer, but this is sunscreen. I put it on, let it sink in, and then went outside. Immediately, I felt the sun on my face. When I wear other over-the-counter sunscreen from the drugstore, once I put sunscreen on my skin, I can't feel the sun. But having this on my skin, I felt like I had nothing when I went out. And that, to me, is very alarming. Because of that, I didn't stay out in the direct light for too long. I mostly wore it as I drove my car, and my car has heavily tinted side windows. I wanted to love this product. I just do not feel secure with this on my skin."

I thought it would be okay because usually Korean skin care is good for me. This however is made with US sunscreen ingredients and it has all the filters. When I put it on my fingers close to my eyes, they burned a bit. The sunscreen on my face just felt uncomfortable and I had to remove it as soon as I got home. My eyes are now really irritated, but I did forget sunglasses today, so I can't fully blame that on the sunscreen. However, my eyes usually feel like this when I've used a sunscreen that bothers me.

I'm going to use the rest of it on my body, but will not use it on my face again. I would not recommend people with sensitive skin to buy this for the face. At $44.00, it's far too expensive to use on the body when you only get 3.38fl oz. The texture was easily absorbable, but the old school filters just burn. I usually get all of my sunscreen from Korea or Japan. This is just a miss imo."

4⭐️- I would recommend it as the one to get.

This is a physical sunscreen, which means it sits on my skin and reflects the sun’s rays. It is thicker than chemical sunscreen but leaves my skin with a matte finish. When you wear physical sunscreen, you do have to make sure that you blend the sunscreen on your skin so that you don’t leave white streak marks.

I passed this on to my daughter because PHYSICAL sunscreens are unsuitable for my sensitive skin. My daughter has no issues and finds this an excellent sunscreen for those days she will be in the sun.

Apply after moisturizer.

EXPIRATION DATE: UPON OPENING!
I always check for an expiration date before using, ESPECIALLY with health & beauty products. This product does not have one, which means the expiration is between 12-18 months UPON OPENING.

It's a physical sunscreen which means it combines zinc dioxide and titanium dioxide, and is safe for everyday use.

The sunscreen is thicker than some, which means I can dispense exactly as much as I want. Because it's thick, it takes some extra time to rub into the skin, and for me, it's a little bit heavy for my face. I do like it on my hands/arms/legs, and the fact that it's SPF 50 means that I feel protected in the bright California sun.

With any physical sunscreen, there will almost always be a hint of a white cast. It is barely perceptible with the Dr Jart product, and for me the tradeoff (safety vs no-white-cast) is worth it. It is competitively priced for a quality physical sunscreen, and there is no discernible scent."

The product is made in Canada. Inside is a beautifully designed tube, the cover of which snaps shut. The tiny dispenser hole was sealed with a piece of foil. No date of expiration date is shown either on the box or the tube.

I have tried numerous sunscreens, and this certainly ranks as one of the best from my standpoint for a couple of reasons. Physical (mineral) sunscreens tend to be thick and difficult to apply. More expensive versions are thinner and easier to apply. Chemical sunscreens also fall into the category of being easier to apply but can cost less. Physical sunscreens work by reflecting the sun's rays, and chemical sunscreens work by absorbing the sun's rays. They, then, are absorbed into the skin as opposed to the physical sunscreens, which are not. There is, however, a little confusion here. Physical sunscreens can either use microparticles, which are too large to be absorbed into the skin, or nanoparticles, which are tiny enough to be absorbed. Physical sunscreens with microparticles will stain clothing. This product does not state whether microparticles or nanoparticles are used, but my assumption, due to being able to feel it on top of my skin, indicates to me that microparticles are used. Also, microparticles will very likely make the product visible in terms of leaving a white cast, as opposed to nanoparticle physical sunscreens or chemical sunscreens. Some physical sunscreens use tints to hide the white cast. This Dr. Jart+ Sunscreen, which appears to use microparticles, is not tinted and does not leave a white cast. It is also not watered down as much as those thinner physical sunscreens referred to above. It does, however, go on easily and become invisible. I have not tested its ability to stain, but my assumption is that it will. Its active ingredients and the percentages used indicate a powerful and effective sunscreen, and I highly recommend it. I have paid more for the tiny bottles of thinner physical sunscreens because they are much better in terms of appearance and ease of application, which enhance effectiveness. Also, those tiny bottles last longer than you would think due to the fact that less product is needed in order to provide protection.

I am happy to recommend Dr. Jart+ Mineral Sunscreen because of its invisibility, ease of application, active ingredients (both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide and percentages of those), and, silly me, the beautifully designed packaging. The one criticism I would have is that no expiration date is given. Sunscreens typically last for two years, so that is what I will go by. This is a superior product that, in my opinion, will not disappoint."

Like other SPF levels from Dr. Jart, this Every Day Sun SPF50 does not irritate my sensitive skin. I love using this higher level to prevent hyperpigmentation and sun damage in general. What I also appreciate is the creamy matte finish. It works fine over serums and under makeup with no peeling. This is a mineral sunscreen but it doesn’t leave a white cast on your skin. It is basically invisible. It also does not contain dangerous chemical sunscreens that can be absorbed by the body. The scent is a very faint citrus plus that sunscreen scent. I don’t smell it after it’s on.

This is a 1.69 fl oz squeeze tube that will last me a long time as I will be saving this for face, neck and chest. I like that the cap clicks closed to prevent leaks. Dr. Jart is manufactured in Canada. I wish there were an expiration date included but I use sunscreens a couple years if they are still around.

It’s no surprise most will give positive ratings! It’s disappointing to see you had to go this route for reviews when you deserve much more honest feedback.

I’ve tried many sunscreens recommended by Angie Hot and Flashy and other beauty influencers, but I still have full bottles of all of them because they just don’t work for me. These influencers say they get compliments on their skin, but when I use the same products, I get no compliments, and my skin looks worse than without sunscreen. If you use foundation, then I guess it doesn't matter which one you use as the foundation will screw up whatever good effect the sunscreen would have had on its own but this one is good to wear by itself if you mix a little color with it - specifically though, the Australian Gold Deep.

Some sunscreens are too greasy, some are too sparkly, some dry out my skin, some give me milia, and others leave a white cast or burn my eyes. Tinted ones never seem to match my skin tone—they're either too pink, too orange, or too dark.

This one is similar to the Dr. G Green sunscreen. Both leave a white cast, but neither dries out my skin or causes those other issues. The white cast from this one is actually a plus because when I mix in a tiny bit of the darkest Australian Gold Rich to Deep Sunscreen, it creates a beautiful natural color on my skin. I’ve even received compliments that I have a nice color to my skin! Plus, I don’t need to wear any foundation, and I’m a light Caucasian.

On its own, the Australian Gold makes my skin dry, itchy, and red, but this sunscreen doesn’t do that. When I mix in a bit of the Australian Gold, I still don’t get dryness—just a lovely glow. I can’t get the same effect with any other sunscreen; only this one works for me.

The Dr. G Green sunscreen doesn’t cause dryness either, but it doesn’t mix well to reduce the white cast; it turns almost lavender when I try. It blends out ok to remove the white cast but still, I never have a day where I think ""my skin looks good today"" when I wear it. I’ve read reviews comparing the two, suggesting Dr. G Green is better for dry skin, but that’s not true. I’ve never had drier skin than I do now at 56, and many products dry it out so much that I can’t even use regular cleansers anymore. I have to stick to oily pastes like Clinique’s Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm and follow up with castor oil! If this sunscreen wasn’t meant for dry skin, I’d know, but I have no issues with it. At the same time, it’s not oily or shiny.

Overall, I just look better with this one, and I always have a good skin day when I wear it. It’s the only sunscreen I keep using and repurchasing. I really hope you stay in business because I can’t understand why you don’t have tons of five-star reviews and have to give away free products!"

I like using toners that actually do work to help bring pH balance back to my skin.

I would say that my skin can be very fickle, especially depending on how intact my barrier is, as I do have mild type 1 rosacea. Tea tree oil is normally a pretty helpful ingredient for me, while niacinamide is something I can't handle in larger concentrations when my skin is flaring up (which usually just amounts to mild-severe flushing for me on my cheeks/around eyes/nose that does calm down once I escape the trigger and use calming products.)

I know many people with skin like mine have turned to Dr. Jart+ products, so I figured I'd try this toner and hopefully my review can help someone else like me.

The Teatreement toner does (obviously) smell of tea tree oil, but that fades as the toner is absorbed. It's definitely a watery toner, so I used cotton rounds and/or spray bottle for application. The directions do say to use on clean, damp skin. It does not state the percentage of niacinamide, but I will say that it is the 2nd ingredient listed on the box, after water (see my photo for the full ingredient list.)

This does also contain quite a few hydrating and nourishing ingredients like glycerin, centella, allantoin, green tea, ceramides, etc. There's also salicylic acid about halfway down the list.

I've used this 3 times so far, twice in the AM and once as part of my PM routine. Because it's Summer and hot, my flares have been happening more frequently, so I've been trying really hard to keep them in check.

This toner did not burn or tingle upon application, it soaks in nicely, did provide some calming effects, and it hasn't felt drying. It also has not caused any irritation, which was a pleasant surprise. I haven't been using it daily though, mostly because I don't want to press my luck. It pairs well with my other skincare products and makeup.

I like that it does have a nice ingredient list and isn't harsh. I don't know that it'd be good for my skin for daily use, but it's something I definitely appreciate having around for when I need it."

I followed my daily routine - cleanse, toner, serum, and finally moisturize.  I soaked the cotton ball with this toner and applied it around my neck first to make sure I would not have any irritation.  If you love the tea tree scent then you may want to try this toner.  You can really smell the nice essence of the tea tree.  However, some people who prefer unscented may be turned off by this toner since the tea tree smell is not subtle.

The toner is easy to apply and good for dry skin since I can feel some moisturizing/oily ingredients.  The toner is okay in my opinion and experience however, the price is steep and pricier than the competition.

Overall, this is a toner you may want to check out if you are fond of tea trees."

This Dr.Jart+ Teatreement Face Toner is a decent toner, but I will say it feels and seams to perform exactly like every other tea tree toner I’ve ever used.

This did not cause any flare ups or issues, though, and did not lead to any increased sensitivity or discomfort for my skin, which is awesome!

I appreciate that this formula isn't greasy, so it doesn't battle with make-up if I want to use this as a base layer.

It blends easily and feels nice on the skin, but if you're looking for more substantial coverage, this might not be the best option.

Lightweight, color-correcting serum

I've used Dr. Jart products in the past and it has always been a solid product line. A few years, I was using a Dr. Jart tinted moisturizer with SPF. It worked nicely, but had a pinkish tone and went on pretty thick. I really love this new color-correcting serum, as it's lightweight and color-corrects to your own skin tone. It goes on thin and leaves the tiniest bit of a healthy sheen without being shiny or greasy. The green tone disappears like magic and balances out any redness in your skin. It dries quickly and feels like normal skin. I haven't tried foundation over it, but I think it would work just fine. The color-correcting properties work so well I haven't felt like I needed it! Very cool product and a painless way to wear your daily sunscreen."

I had read that tiger grass helped heal scar tissue, so this product was a contender to try as it hails from the Korean cosmetics industry which has been on fire and is still blazing trails. This serum is a color corrector in that it tints your face in a lighter tone. It does help minimize the perceptibly of the scar, but after prolonged use, there has been no improvement. In fact, I think it might be slightly worse from all the rubbing during application. It is advised to apply sun protection to scars, so as a concealer and shield, this is a great product.

This is a fragrance free product, but it is lightly scented from the ingredients. It does have some oils that might increase sun sensitivity, so it is nice that the product includes SPF. Since only a few drops of this product are used in an application, it is nowhere near thick enough to provide actual sun protection. (The SPF is fairly low, too.) Still, I'll take all the SPF I can get. Layered with a sunscreen, it is a little extra protection.

This is a nice serum if redness is one of your skincare concerns."

I've tried countless products, but have never really been satisfied with the results until now.

I've heard others sing the praises of Dr. Jart+ products for awhile now, so I absolutely jumped at this opportunity. The Tiger Grass Camo Drops wear so beautifully. The formula is lighter than the tiger grass cream, which is perfect for the hot, humid weather we've been having. It doesn't melt off my face at all.

I am 35, so I do have some fine lines, and I'm really pleased with how little this settles into those lines. I have combo skin, oily T zone with dryer cheeks, nose, and eye area. I take good care of my skin and try to keep my moisture barrier intact to prevent my skin from being so reactive. I typically can't tolerate higher percentages of niacinamide, and though these drops do contain niacinamide, it has not caused any irritation at all. I'm so happy that it hasn't, because the coverage these provide is top notch! It hasn't dried my skin out either.

These drops have a thin, serum like consistency. They do have that faint herbal scent (I believe it may be tea tree?) but it isn't noticeable once it dries down. A little goes a very long way, but the coverage is buildable. I'm actually pale enough that I can get away with not wearing foundation over the drops, but I did test that out for review purposes, and it layered really well underneath. No pilling or separation, didn't accentuate pores or dry patches. It dries down fairly quickly, but I've found it best to let dry completely before adding foundation or concealer.

The coverage is very long lasting, and it dries down to a pretty, dewy looking finish. If you aren't wearing foundation on top, the dewy effect can be toned down easily with some setting powder/spray if that's preferred. It plays well with all the other makeup and skincare products I've tried with it.

After using this, my skin tone was so much more even than I'm used to that I was like ""wow, I actually do need to wear blush and bronzer with this"" lol. There's a swatch in one of my pics, taken inside with overhead light on and in front of a window.

For my fellow flushing peeps: I flush as soon as I step outside. So I can apply this when my cheeks aren't even that red and step outside, feel my cheeks flaring, but you still can't really see the redness peeking out. No other product has done such a fantastic job of hiding the flushing. I also do flare a little around my eyes, so there were a couple days I used this rather than concealer for my under eye area. It works great, but I did feel that it dried out that thin under eye skin a slight bit. It didn't do that to my cheeks though.

In conclusion, I am converted. This stuff is amazing."

Next time, I tried a different moisturizer, and voila - no pilling! So the moisturizer matters, and you may have to test out some different things until you find the combo that works for you. I have never used a product like this before, but I really like it because I don’t like to wear heavy foundation, but I have some sunspots and redness that I like to lightly even out. This product helps me do that. I could pretty much just wear this serum without any foundation, but I have not worked myself up to that level yet."

I use it over top of my moisturizer but without makeup. I stopped doing a full face, and this is great for me. It does go on whitish, but then blends to match your skin tone (I am a medium skin tone, and this looks flawless on me). It takes a bit to rub in and you only literally need 2-3 drops to cover your face.

I swim almost daily in the warmer weather, but this is terrible for the pool. It kind of slides off and doesn't offer protection (and will be visible on your towel, swimsuit, anywhere your face may have touched, etc. when you dry off.) It does wash out without any pretreatment - my gear is not stained like if I was wearing a foundation... but I do not recommend for pool days, even though it's easy and makes your skin look great."

I'm sad that my jar came less than half full - I'm hoping that was just a mistake and not how every jar comes because it is expensive but well worth it if it works for your skin tone.

It didn't lay over my skincare and immediately made my products peel. I waited for my products to completely dry before applying this product but as soon as I started applying this started my products and this started to peel. In addition, the base gave me a white cast which was probably a cool neutral undertone over an actually white cast, but my face was noticeably cool neutral, which is not my color family. Unfortunately because it makes my skincare peel I can't wear it alone to just tint because of the peeling and color.

This one is a thick serum with a dropper, and the other one is a dense cream version. I honestly like them both and don't have preference to one versus the other, as they both work for me.
So this serum is a little thick, but it rubs into the skin and becomes almost invisible. Less is more here. Don't rely on this product for sunscreen, you must use other sunscreen underneath. My facial skin is very red, so I'm a prime candidate to wear this product. A thin layer, worked well into the skin, doesn't stay green. It just melts into my skin and works away the red and irritated appearance. I followed with my foundation on top and needed to use less of it because my skin wasn't red anymore. I also wore this product alone with no foundation and my face looked looked normal, only without redness. I really love this product and highly recommend it.

Unlike most sunscreens, it's packaged in a glass bottle with a dropper that dispenses the serum. It is heavy for a serum, with a somewhat glue-like texture, and has a natural fragrance that's faintly medicinal and not at all objectionable to me.

Because this is SPF 35, it provides good protection. The fluid dries quickly and evens out skin tone. I would not say that it gives me any kind of glow. On the contrary, the effect is rather masklike. I would not wear it to a Fourth of July party, but it's fine for most days."

For the right person this stuff would be awesome, I mean it’s basically a really sheer color correcting tinted serum with SPF.

The issue is that I have fair/light skin with a cool undertone. And just like the OG one on me this ends up looking literally orange once it’s massaged in. It’s like this orange/yellow/green hue that just doesn’t look good on me at all.

Now if you have light-medium, medium, or even medium-deep skin then this would likely work wonderfully for you, but on me it looks horrible.

And it’s a shame too because I really like the finish and how it feels on my skin. And the fact that it has spf on it is wonderful. And it also cuts down on redness wonderfully which I could definitely use. It’s just simply not made for my skin color unfortunately."

There is no fragrance and just a minimum of scrub material. The grains are so few and far between that I don't see the benefit of including them. But the grains do provide a bit of stimulation. If a good amount of scrubbing particles is a must in your cleanser, look for a different product.

My skin felt clean, not necessarily refreshed. Dense, almost sticky, gel that turns to a thick, small-bubbled white foam, which takes some time to rinse off.

But, I didn't find it to foam really at all when applied to my face. Stayed more of a gel consistency. That said, I didn't find it to foam too much between my hands either... so I'm just not sure!

You have to emulsify the little beads in the cleanser really well to get the foam started. I usually start emulsifying in my hand before washing my face with it but it helps to ensure you really scrub your face well if you start out on you face rubbing the gel in until it foams. This cleanser is probably better for oily or combination skin, it is not quite as moisturizing a cleanser as I like to use on older drier skin but does the job of getting your face well and clean."

It was quite thick and it seemed to take a long time to completely rinse it off. I used more product than I should have and put it directly on my face instead of mixing it with water in my hands first. I've since changed to using it in the shower and now I look forward to using it. Only a small amount is required, even less than pea size, so the tube will last a long time. I mix it with water in my hands and when I massage into my skin I can feel the tiny mint capsules dissolve. To me it has a light citrus/grapefruit scent which fades quickly. In the shower it is much easier to rinse off, leaving my skin clear and face feeling extremely soft."

Weird I know but it's an anxious habit I've dealt with my entire life which seems to be exacerbated by the fact I have psoriasis. I was looking around for lip balms that were super moisturizing that would prevent dry skin on my lips and therefore alleviate my need to peel the skin from my lips and from the articles I read I gathered that something with ceramides would be helpful and let me tell you in the month since I bought this I've definitely noticed a difference. My lips stay hydrated far longer. There's far less dry skin so I don't feel the need nearly as much to remove the dry skin. I would definitely recommend this product to someone with dry skin issues on their lips because it's definitely helping me.

It wears so well that I really don't mind the price. While it does seem to come out of the tube a bit thicker, it melts down into a nice, thin, not at all sticky glossy finish on the lips and really provides a lot of moisture. I've been using it during the day and at night below my lip mask and my lips maintain the moisture they get from it much of the day. It isn't at all one of those lip balms that just make things worse so you're forced to use more and more of the product. The container is quite small but since it comes out pretty thick and thins out on the lips, I really don't think I'm using very much at all (I suppose I'll find out once the container is gone, though). I love that there is no scent or taste to it as well."

It does not have a noticeable scent or taste. It is thick, but thins out as you apply it to your lips. The thicker consistency is helpful for controlling how much I apply at a time; I can squeeze out more if needed, without accidentally getting too much product at once. It's not sticky at all, and it makes my lips look slightly glossy. It works well underneath lipstick, as well. It wears about as long as an average lip balm before needing to be reapplied.

This lip balm does a fairly good job of moisturizing my lips. I've worn this consistently when my lips have been chapped, and I've noticed that they have gotten smoother more quickly than they would have without using it. However, the tube is small, and the lip balm does not contain SPF. I've tried other lip balms that perform similarly and are a better value (or at least contain SPF). So, I'm not sure I will purchase a new tube when I run out of this, but it's still a good lip balm. I'd recommend it if you're sensitive to fragrances or are otherwise just looking for a comfortable lip balm."

I love barrier repair product, this is a great option for the daytime as many are thicker night creams. I do feel like it leaves the skin nice an plump after application.

I use is after showering and shaving, before SPF (now mineral-based); as directed by much of what I have read. This product goes on thin; a little spreads over a large area. You definitely need less than you think. As a moisturizer, I like it. As anti-aging, too early to tell. I am definitely going to stick with this through a full bottle though..."

It is unscented, yay and sensitive skin friendly. I have dry skin, and it does a nice job in making my skin feel refreshed and hydrated. I use products that are more anti-aging w/ my night routine, but love using it in the day. I pat a few drops on my face, before following with a serum and (SPF) moisturizer. $37 at time of review. I think that's fair, it's a good brand, has great ingredients, a decent size, gender neutral, and a little goes a long way."

4⭐️- I would recommend it as the one to get.

Usually, I would cleanse my face, apply toner and serum, and finish with moisturizer. However, with this toner/serum, I wash my face, use this product, and then finish with the moisturizer. This bottle will last me quite some time because I only use a couple of drops on the tip of my fingers and then rub it on my face. I would not suggest using a cotton pad or cotton ball because it will only waste the product since it’s more of a serum than a toner.

I like that this product is free of all those chemicals that can strip your skin's natural oil. It has Panthenol, which soothes my skin while creating a barrier to keep it hydrated throughout the day. I don’t see a need to use the usual serum, and when I’m using this product, it’s taking away one step in the process of my facial regimen, saving me a couple of minutes.

EXPIRATION DATE: 03/15/2026
I always check for an expiration date before using, ESPECIALLY with health & beauty products.

This smooths on effortlessly and then does not slip or drip at all. I left this on until it was virtually dry. And, when I removed it, my skin was just so clarified, so hydrated, so nourished! I was really impressed!

Do not rinse. Instead, just enjoy the remaining serum and enjoy the incredible glow!

A really incredible mask! Treat yourself!"

I was extremely impressed with the quality of this mask. Not only did it soothe my angry skin but it helped it stay hydrated. It definitely helped with rebalancing it. Lots of product on the mask as well.

Unfortunately I was not able to do chores or anything because I found that it slid off my face. That's ok, the dogs were looking at me weird anyway so I took the opportunity to lay down and just relax for 30 minutes. I got up feeling refreshed and my skin felt and looked so much better.

Great product."

I was miserable the entire time I was in the air. I was super happy to come home from holiday and find this mask waiting for me. The listing says: ""One use delivers all-day hydration, relieves dry skin, and improves visible fine, dry lines."" I put that TO THE TEST. I washed my face this morning, used toner, then applied this mask for 20 minutes. I am please to report that the mask, while loaded with product, didn't slip and slide down my face, so I was able to unpack and do laundry while waiting for my 20 minute timer to end. Once the 20 minutes was up, I removed the mask, tapped in the serum, and went about my day. I didn't use eye cream, serums, moisturizer, face oil, absolutely nothing. And you know what? 12 hours later my SKIN STILL FEELS PLUMP AND HYDRATED! This mask seemed really expensive at first, but oh my gosh, for those times when your skin is just BEGGING for moisture this is the mask you need."

I used before bed and my face still felt really good in the morning. Smooth, hydrated. I feel like this would be wonderful to use prior to applying makeup, I kind of wish I had saved it for before a date with my husband. The way my skin felt after would make a really good base for foundation I think.

My only caveat is you only get one mask, currently priced around $10. That's quite a lot. I'm not sure if the quality truly reflects the price, but it is definitely higher quality than others I've tried so maybe? You'll have to just that part for yourself. I enjoyed it but I don't know that I would order again unless it was lower cost or you got more than one for the price."

For one, the mask sheet itself didn’t seem like a universal size, as the eye holes were too small for me and I’d never had that issue before. The serum is very slick and fluid, so the sheet kept sliding down my face. It’s supposed to sit for 15-20 minutes, so ultimately I had to readjust it one more time and just lay down on my bed so it wouldn’t slide down. Unfortunately, it’s not convenient to use since I couldn’t multitask. However, the serum did seem to work at making my face look better. Even several hours afterward, my face didn’t look red. So for the price of this mask per fraction of an ounce, a better option would be to get Dr. Jart’s Cicapair serum in a bottle and just spread a layer over the face and skip the mask."

This mask is very goopy and holds a lot of product, and took a sec to unfold to put on. I left this mask on for 15 minutes, but within the first 5 minutes I felt my skin feeling a bit irritated. I should have probably removed it then, but I thought that maybe this mask was supposed to feel like that as some skincare products will have a very slight burning/tingling feeling initially on the skin that is normal, which was not the case I believe for this mask. When I removed I patted my face dry with a hand towel, but after my face started to feel very itchy and hot I completely washed my face.

After about an hour my face is feeling normal again but it is definitely even more red from what I believe is an allergic reaction. Overall I am not sure this product works or not, but make sure to check the ingredients to see if you are allergic to anything before using."

My personal experience with other products that had cica in them was that I had to let my skin get used to the product for a couple of usages before the irritation went away. If it is your first time exposing your skin to the ingredient cica, it could be quite harsh hence why some people with sensitive skin mentioned that this mask irritated their skin. With usual cica topical products, those have a lower dosage of cica so I would recommend giving those products a try to see if your skin would have adverse effects to cica before applying this concentrated face mask version of cica onto your face. My skin didn't get irritated from this mask and in fact, I did notice a significant improvement in my skin's redness immediately after taking the face mask off."

As an everyday sheet mask it did not disappoint. It was a little difficult to get spread out upon opening the package as it has tons of serum on the mask. Once on, the smell is a little overwhelming. It smells like something natural, kind of grassy honestly. The mask felt great on my face, very cooling and hydrating. Again, there's tons of product on the mask. I left it on for 20 minutes and rubbed the rest of the serum in as directed. Even after taking the mask off there's still tons of serum left on my face waiting to be absorbed.

This is a single mask folded and saturated is serum in the package. When I opened the package I had to remove and open the mask in order to place it on my face. When I opened it and put it on my face it felt really cooling and there was a lot (I do mean a LOT) of serum available to my face. The face mask was a little awkward to put on and the holes sort of fit my face. My face felt a little tingly around my eyes and I am not sure if that was it being irritating or it working or from the mask itself.

I left the mask on my face for 20 minutes and when I took it off I rubbed some of the serum to my neck and then let the rest of the serum absorb into my face. It took quite a while for the rest of the serum to absorb. It did not bother my skin after I removed the mask (so it may have been the way the mask was cut) and it did leave my skin well hydrated. I did use the mask in the evening so I was able to let it soak in overnight when I didn't add anything else to my face in order to get the most benefit from it.

The mask was ok. Not my favorite product and it was a bit difficult to use.

⭐️ 1 star - I don't recommend it at all, poor quality, or it does not reflect the advertising.

In particular, I leave out sheet masks as they are more 'stuff' to toss in a landfill, and as well, I don't have the patience to sit around with something stuck to my face.

But the price of sheet masks do not make sense to me in the realm of my skincare routine. Consider that the price of this one mask (at time of this review) is $9.50. If you use it once a week, that's $38 a month for a mask. I'd rather take that $38 and put it towards a really good serum that I can use for multiple months.

This mask, like many others, is okay. The amount of time it sits on the skin may or may not help it to penetrate better. I know that the allantoin in it is an anti-inflammatory and may help with dark spots, but so do really good serums with allantoin, or niacinamide, or vitamin c.

It's slimy feeling and much of the serum goes to waste unless you try to use every bit elsewhere on your body. It will feel tacky to the touch for some time. I didn't have any irritation from it at all on my rosacea-prone skin.

I do a Pat & Press with my skincare and I did try that both while the mask was on and after I took it off. That does help the serum to absorb and helps not to tug at the face, and as well, warms the skin that may help with absorption.

They did not list the ingredients so I have no idea what is in this mask to make it worth almost $10. I wish skincare brands would be better about listing the ingredients.

I'll pass on this one."

It has a subtle, clean scent to it and is tinted green. You can't see the green tint once you rub it in, however. It feels like it's mostly glycerin, so you can really feel it sealing your skin in. You definitely need to use something hydrating underneath it, like a serum or toner. This doesn't provide much moisture on it's own, but rather keeps your skin from losing moisture.

I can't say this worked well for me. I think it caused me to have some small breakouts. It felt like it was suffocating my skin. It's also not a good value. Granted, a little goes a long way, but the cost for the size tube you get is not great. I think there are better similar products out there for less."

•Lightweight: It doesn't feel heavy or greasy under moisturizer, which is great in the summer.
•Gentle: No irritation on my sensitive skin.

A couple of minor drawbacks:

I have mature combination skin that still, on occasion, gets oily and develops an eruption that needs to be dealt with. Usually just along the nose area. It's quite common for me to use skincare products with lots of moisturization along most of my face and something for more youthful skin along my nose. Then there are days when I use the oil sopping products all over my face to clear everything away and give my skin an oil break before starting all over again with a more intense moisturization regimen.

This cream is fantastic for me to use for spot work, especially along my nose. Not only does it help to control excess sebum production, but it also helps to minimize pore size. What I really love is that it goes to work right away to settle down any sort of disruption that's taking place. It's so clean and soothing. Does not dry out the skin nor strip away too many of the essential oils either. Leaves the skin along my nose in perfect balance. Plus it immediately goes to work to shrink and destroy that eruption that is starting to develop. After application, you can run your finger along the applied area and feel a thin layer of the set gel that stays in place to continue to protect your skin. Stays and works for many hours on end for your protection.

Oh, how I wish that I had this stuff many years ago. Meanwhile, I'm very happy that I have it now."

The redness is uneven too and comes and goes.

Per the instructions you can use this on certain areas of the face or on the entire face. Due to the small amount and high price I opted to only use on the redness areas of my face which is the most area I feel self conscious.

The product goes on easy and absorbs in to the skin like a typical face lotion. After approximately 2 weeks, to my surprise, I was visibly able to notice a difference in the redness on my face. It almost completely went away. I would say the redness is now 90% less but also less patchy as well.

Overall, I've been quite impressed with this product but my one negative is the price. For what you're getting here with the small bottle, I'm not sure it's a great value for the money. Even though my redness has mostly went away my biggest question is will my redness come back like before if I stop using the product? I'm hoping it's gone but only time will tell. If the redness does come back this means I'd need to use this product all the time for as long as I didn't want the redness on my face.

This Korean skincare brand has created a concentrated treatment serum that delivers targeted relief to stressed skin. Here's an honest review of my experience:

Soothing and Calming:
One of the standout features of this face treatment is its ability to instantly soothe and calm irritated skin. Enriched with centella asiatica, a powerful skin-repairing ingredient, this serum provides a comforting sensation to inflamed and reactive complexions. My skin felt relieved and comforted, especially during periods of sensitivity and redness.

Skin Barrier Repair:
The formula is designed to support the skin's natural barrier, helping to strengthen and protect it. Centella asiatica, a key ingredient, promotes the regeneration of the skin's protective barrier, aiding in the recovery process. Over time, I noticed an improvement in my skin's overall resilience and health.

Lightweight and Quick-Absorbing:
The serum has a lightweight and fluid texture, absorbing quickly into the skin. It provides an immediate soothing sensation without leaving any greasy or sticky residue. My skin felt refreshed and balanced, with no heavy or oily sensation often associated with richer creams.

Redness Reduction:
The formula effectively targets redness and inflamed skin, a common concern for sensitive skin types. The combination of centella asiatica and other calming ingredients helps alleviate redness, providing a more even and calm complexion. With regular use, I noticed a visible improvement in the overall appearance of my skin's redness.

Suitable for Sensitive Skin:
As a K-beauty enthusiast with sensitive skin, I appreciate that this face treatment is carefully formulated to be gentle and non-irritating. Free from potential irritants like parabens and fragrances, it ensures a safe and soothing experience for even the most delicate complexions.

Overall Complexion Enhancement:
Not only does this treatment address redness and irritation, but it also enhances the overall appearance of the skin. My skin looked healthier and more radiant, with a noticeable improvement in texture and tone. It created a smooth and even canvas for subsequent skincare products.

Overall Recommendation:
As a K-beauty enthusiast, I highly recommend the Dr.Jart+ Cicapair So Soothing Face Treatment to anyone seeking a calming and repairing solution for irritated and sensitive skin. The concentrated formula, enriched with centella asiatica, delivers targeted relief, enhances the skin's barrier, and reduces redness. It's a must-have in your skincare arsenal for times when your complexion needs soothing relief."

I can now wear makeup, be in the sun a bit, workout and do other normal things without triggering bad rosacea.

I'm also very wary of products that promise instant results, and this moisturizer did not live up to its claims of reducing redness. I have sensitive skin prone to redness from various causes, including rosacea flare-ups, but I saw no improvement (in terms of amount of redness) after using this product. It also didn't help the redness from other forms of irritation, such as facial acne, slightly damaged skin, or sunburn.

I am also rather confused on exactly what this product is meant for. It mentions it's safe to use after laser treatment, but does not mention that as a ""requirement""; so I assumed anyone can use this, laser treated or not. Based on my lack of results, I assume this was only meant to reduce redness from a laser treatment then. I also do not like how thick this moisturizer is. This is already an expensive product, and since it is so thick it causes you to use more of the product to get an even coat over the face since it does not spread as well as a thinner/lighter moisturizer would.

Personally, I still prefer my Olay facial moisturizer over this Dr.Jart+ moisturizer. Olay's is less expensive, spreads more easily, and feels more refreshing after use. The Dr.Jart+ moisturizer does seem to last longer though, without the need of reapplying as often. Both moisturizers provide moisture without leaving a greasy feeling, but at vastly different price points. I will continue to try this Dr.Jart+ moisturizer for a longer period and see if there are any further results, but so far its claims of reducing redness does not seem true and it seems no better than cheaper facial moisturizers.

Overall, for my very dry, fair, and sensitive skin, the Dr.Jart+ moisturizer does not offer enough benefits to warrant its high price. I would not recommend it when there are more affordable options available that provide equal or better results."

You don’t need a ton of the serum to get a positive effect, but, you do only get 1.01 ounces of product for the purchase price, which compared to other products in this type of category (there aren’t many), it’s priced at the upper end of the spectrum.

-----

First experience with Dr.Jart+.

I am disappointed there are no ingredients listed so I went to the Dr.Jart website and pulled them from there and put them through an ingredients checker. A couple of 'best' but most were 'good' - there were no 'worst,' but there were a few unrated/unknown ingredients.

I would expect for a 'premium' skincare product to have more 'best' ingredients. Paying a little more for skincare is fine as long as the ingredients are powerful. Though this certainly isn't as pricey as some premium skincare.

It does have allantoin, which is a 'powerhouse' ingredient in that it can maybe lighten dark spots, has anti-inflammatory properties, and helps with skin renewal and repair - not as potent as a retinoid/retinol, but good.

It felt very soothing to my rosacea-prone skin. Not sure if it calmed redness as my cheeks tend to have a little redness in the mornings and evenings. However, no irritation. And this along with my other skincare did help my rosacea-cream to absorb very smoothly.

I will want to use this for a while to see if I really like it. But first impressions are good."

PROS:
- Nice packaging. Makes it easy to dispense just the proper amount (no wasted product is soooo important!) for use.
- Seems to absorb into skin fine. Not the best I've tried but fine.
- I appreciate that it is scentless!

CONS:
- Not sure the ingredients since I don't read Korean!
- Very expensive so the value of the results to price would not be there for repurchase
- Some days, my face seemed sticky after applying this product. (MIght have been a temperature/humidity thing as it was not always this way)"

It works really well for layering my other serums without getting all sticky and/or slimy. I live in Southerm California so it is mildly humid and hot. Hyalauronic acid draws from water from the environment and helps keep skin moist. I feel like this definitely did that. However, I do feel it is a bit overpriced. Hyalauronic acid products are a dime a dozen. But this brand definitely did a good job on the ingredient mix and my skin likes it a lot.

This is a very watery essence (toner) that you apply with either a cotton pad or fingers. I went with fingers. I found it took a while to fully dry, but when it did, it was almost imperceptible on my skin. I normally use a thicker hyaluronic acid serum, which definitely provides more moisture than this. I don't think this is all that effective at hydrating. I usually layer a thicker moisturizer on top to seal in moisture as well, but the days I used this I found my skin felt more tight and dry than when I use a different source of hyaluronic acid."

When patted on my skin on its own, it has a slightly tacky feel, but leaves your skin with a smooth feel and a touch of glow. I like using it when I don't need to apply anything with it, but only want some moisturizing and pore minimizing. If I'm just hanging around the house, it seems like the perfect clean touch.

However, I don't like it under moisturizers or my tinted sunscreens. I feel like it causes them to ""sit"" on top of the skin rather than absorb, and I'm not getting full benefit from them."

The Dr. Jart Vital Hydra Solution works very well for me and I like the effect it has on my face. The first time I felt like it helped my fine lines and softened my face. It is liquid and the directions say to use with your hands or a cotton pad. I tried it both ways and it is very runny, a little thicker then water, and felt it was better managed with the cotton pad. It goes on smoothly and is absorbed and dried very quickly. Once absorbed you are ready for the next product in your facial routine. Once absorbed you do not feel like anything is on your face.

I have had no skin reactions to this product and it really does not have any scent to it.

I love the packaging and the bottle is very stylish and fun to have on your counter. Great for yourself or as a gift. I am sure I will be ordering this again. This is a fantastic product that I really like.

Initially the very first time I went to put it on as soon as I put it into my palms and started patting it into my face I thought that it was going to be a winner for me. I love all essences, but especially if they have that nice slippery feel to them. The only thing that can ruin an essence for me is if it feels either after applying it feels insanely oily, sticky or tacky, or makes my makeup and other skincare pill.

Unfortunately this essence does feel extremely sticky and tacky after applying, and that doesn’t go away hardly at all as it dries down and is absorbed. Which is really weird since initially it feels so hydrating and slick, and has that nice almost watery gel like texture to it. But I’m big on how a product feels on my skin throughout the day, and unfortunately this is a no go for my due to the texture."

This lotion is THICK and STICKY. It was incredibly hydrating and easy to apply, a little bit also goes a long way. But even after going to bed and waking up 8hrs later my face is still a bit sticky. I will definitely be using the rest of this up quickly because the hydration is amazing, the stickiness doesn’t bother me that much and goes away with a quick wash and rinse in the morning. I’m happy with the product just a liiiitle put off by the stickiness. But i think it’s a testament to the lotion that I’m willing to use it all, despite that shortcoming."

It's consistency is very light and watery and it has a pleasant scent. It did not absorb as readily as other lightweight moisturizers but I used more than a pea sized portion for each side of my face so I might have over done it a bit.

It's been over 30 minutes and my skin still feels a bit tacky from this cream. I am wondering if it is having a difficult time absorbing due to the silicones in it. This Hydro Plump Water Cream have some very nice hydrating ingredients like betaine, glycerin, sodium hyaluronate, pentavitin and niacinamide. All great for hydrating, smoothing, and protecting the skin.

What it also has is vinyl dimethicone and phenyl trimethicone. These are synthetic silicones that are put in skin care products to help the product spread easier. They also give the skin a velvety soft look and can make the skin look smoother. Another reason they've used is because they form a barrier on the skin to keep moisture in... They have a high molecular weight so literally cannot be absorbed and leave a film on the skin. Problem for some is that this barrier also keeps in bacteria, which can lead to breakouts or other issues.

Aside from that the main reason I do not like silicone based ingredients is that they are bad for the environment. Vinyl dimethicone is a microplastic that is non-biodegradable. It is also toxic to marine life.

For those reasons I will not use products with silicones in them and cannot recommend those products to others."

The dryness on my cheeks is gone, and it doesn't cause any breakouts in my T-zone or make it oily at all. The one downside during this hot and humid summer is that it's a bit more than I need for a daily moisturizer, but switching to every other day works just fine. (Said as a girl with no 'skincare routine' to speak of...) The size of this product is gigantic, and though expensive, will last me well over a year."

There is always going to be a bit of a controversy since 'brightening' in Korean skincare often means 'lightening' and melanated people have taken a bit of offense to that.

Since this isn't a dark spot removing product, that's the context in which 'brightening' exists--a mild skin tone lightening.

I think you can probably get a C and Niacinimide combo for cheaper, and I know you can get a vitamin C serum for crazy cheap, so this might be marked up higher than necessary.

It took me a little while to figure out how to use the bottle and applicator, but afterwards it was fine. I haven’t seen too much of difference, but I’ve only been using for a couple of weeks now. I definitely recommend using SPF when you’re wearing it. But besides that I really like it. Also, it also has a really nice citrus smell to it.

Pros
Great for sensitive skin.
Contains niacinamide

Takes a little while to figure out how to properly use the bottle"

I like how the serum is a water like consistency and sinks into skin immediately. There is no burning or tingling upon application. You can layer another serum with more hydrating properties on top of this will no problems at all. I wait 20 minutes before doing so, in order to let the Vitamin C work - I read that you should do that years ago and have always followed that rule, with good results.

This has no scent or fragrance at all, and a little goes a long way. While this says it is a 7 day brightening treatment, there is much more product than you can use in 7 days. The package says this must be used in 30 days, which is typical for a Vitamin C product also, as the effectiveness degrades.

I haven't noticed any results yet, but I am not through with the bottle. I will reevaluate this when it is empty to see if I'll be repurchasing or going back to ""my usual"" vitamin C."

I think this is Vitamin C powder. I did think this was a little gimmicky and did not have much hope but I used twice a day for 7 days and have just finished.. The thin yellow serum is used in one very small dropper at a time. I do think it has had a slight effect. My skin was stressed and looking patchy and uneven and I think after 7 days my skin is more even toned. I should have taken a before photo.

If you know about vitamin c it is sensative to exposure whether that be from the environment or what it’s mixed with. It’s nice to know the vitamin itself hasn’t been stagnant on a shelf just withering away I some concoction. It’s also great that the bottle isn’t clear though I would prefer it to be a darker green or black color but it sits in a closed cabinet so light exposure is minimal. I won’t really know its effects u til about 90 days. That’s the thing about skin care is it’s a waiting game really. This is suppose to be a 30 day supply. So paying 35$ days each time is expensive and not available for everyone especially during this time. I do think they can get the price down for what it is. Pretty much glycerin and vitamin C. I love the consistency? It’s non greasy it goes on smoothly and sits well under and over other products. You can easily make this last more than 30 days. You only need 1-2 droplets of the serum. If this was about half price I would buy this all the time and I do trust this brand.

One need to “activate” the vitamin C ball by dropping it into the serum, so the vitamin C doesn’t degrade while the product sit on the shelf (generally vitamin C products are recommended to be used up within a few months or stored in an opaque bottle away from sunlight to minimize oxidation). If one is to use up the product within 7 days, technically the vitamin C would be at its peak potency. Following the logic, this is a really expensive skincare product if one is to purchase four of this every month. I mean, yes, the serum has been very moisturizing and firming on the face, but that’s quite an effort to restock this product so frequently and at this price tag, when there are many other products out there.

But, tbh, the color correcting SPF was why I ordered it. To see other people's reviews, it looks like it works like magic.

Unfortunately, I found yet again, you can't believe everything you see on the Internet.

I am on a constant search for a good moisturizer/SPF bc I use it daily and it's kind of my obsession.

If I didn't know anything about this product, I would give it low rating and toss it. But I will keep using it in case it's just user error on my part... although I really can't figure out how to use this in a way that works for my skin type.

I have medium olive skin. This goes on with an obvious white cast that disperses a bit but still makes me look a shade paler than I am. I don't know how it will look on even darker skin tones. I have dry areas but routinely moisturize so I didn't habe any actively flaky areas when I tried this. The green cream goes on and feels a little tacky and it's a little difficult to rub in. I was worried it wouldn't ""melt"" into my skin so much as settle on top of it - and that's totally what this does. Especially around my nose - I just see product awkwardly apparent...looking a bit dry.

I think I will need to figure out how to mix this into some sort of moisturizer to help it blend and settle better. Very disappointing given the price point and hype.

I still think it may be worth trying - maybe it will work better for you and your skin type. But I truly haven't found a ""color correcting"" or ""foundation replacing"" SPF moisturizer that isn't problematic.

I'll post a pic but it's so hard to photograph. Just be aware that if you're out and about, it will be obvious that you have product on your face bc this settles in dry areas or nooks (esp around nose) and give you an extra dusty/dry/flaky look. Iykyk."

I have combo skin, sensitive, rosacea, and am pale. If you'd like to see the ingredients lists for each product, they're in my photos. For most of the products, niacinamide is decently low on the ingredient list, just fyi. I haven't experienced any irritation so far.

The tiger grass color correcting cream has a lovely finish. I can get away with not wearing foundation over it, but it evens my skin out so well that I definitely have to add some color back in. If you want to wear it on its own, any shine can easily be toned down with setting powder or spray if needed. It still looks great at the end of the day, really long lasting. A little goes a long way, so this jar should last awhile. It blends really easily, too. Does pair well with my other makeup.

The Cicapair foaming cleanser is super gentle and doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped of moisture (it contains glycerin!) I feel like it does a pretty good job of removing residue, but I do use a gentle micellar water first to make sure my sunscreen and stuff dissolves before I actually wash with a cleanser.

One of my favorites so far is the Cicapair intensive soothing repair cream. It's a thicker, waxy/silky type cream, but it doesn't take a ton to cover your face. It's green coming out of the tube, but there's no color once applied to skin. It has so many high quality ingredients to help repair skin's barrier, soothe, and lock in mousture. I personally wouldn't think this would wear well under makeup; I think it's more for PM routine use. It is incredibly nourishing and really helps my skin a lot.

Lastly, the intensive soothing repair serum mask feels amazing. It's a cellulose sheet mask with a gel like fabric, packed with serum. I wore it for about 20 minutes and massaged in any remaining serum. It's incredibly hydrating, cooling, and soothing. It contains a lot of the same ingredients as the aforementioned cream.

If you'd like to dip your toes into the Dr. Jart+ Cicapair line, I'd highly recommend giving this kit a try to see if your skin agrees with the commonly used ingredients between the products. As someone with sensitive/reactive skin and rosacea, I'm really thrilled that I can actually use all the products."

I didn't really like using any of these, unfortunately, so none of them were that great, in my opinion.

Cleanser: This is a decent, semi-moisturizing cleanser. I find it's not strong enough to remove sunscreen and make-up, but it also doesn't strip my skin of moisture. I liked this ok, but it's not as good as other cleansers I've used that are lot less expensive.

Mask: It's a standard sheet mask. I found it felt a tiny bit stingy at first, but I got used to it quickly. It moisturized my skin just fine, but wasn't anything special.

Barrier repair moisturizer: This is a thick moisturizer with a lot of glycerin. You really need a serum or toner on under it, to hydrate. This does a good job sealing in moisture, like a top coat. It has a mild grassy smell.

Color correcting spf: This cream is thick and a bit hard to blend. It starts out a greenish-white color, then oxidizes to be more skin colored. I find it's too dark and a warm for my skin tone. It probably would work best for someone with light to medium warm skin tones. You have to use a lot to make the SPF effective, which causes it to feel pretty heavy. I didn't like this and only used it once."

It is a little bit more substantial than a trial set. It really is the whole routine, from cleansing to pampering, it feels like it could be a great part of a vacation. I think that the color-correcting cream with SPF is interesting, I haven't used many of these before - just standalone spf. It is rated at 30SPF though, which I would say is more on the minimal side. I would've liked to see 50, but I don't think it is a huge deal. Of course, when you see the shade of this cream online, you could instantly tell whether or not that shade works for your skin tone."

As it stands, this kit contains a very tiny sample size squeeze tube of Cicapair moisturizer and an equally small container of Cicapair cleansing foam. But there’s a large jar of the color-correcting Cicapair rescue balm. The color changes from green to beige. My skin is brown, so walking about with beige-tinted skin isn’t very helpful for me. I would’ve preferred to have more moisturizer and cleanser instead.

The Cicapair moisturizer works great at providing a skin protective barrier. I use it as the last step in my skin care routine. It helps reduce redness and inflammation and is great for sensitive skin. I don’t use this as my only moisturizer though because, while think that Dr, Jart products are more for locking in moisture, they don’t provide enough skin hydration on their own.

The Cicapair foaming cleanser is a wonderful, gentle skin cleanser that leaves my face feeling refreshed. It foams easily and rinses clean.

This kit isn’t a great value. In fact it’s extremely expensive. These products are customer sample size and Dr Jart should feel ashamed for selling these at such exorbitant costs. Still, the products work well. I think it’s probably better to search out discounts and buy directly from the Dr Jart website."

You get a substantial amount of products , some of them are my favorites from Dr Jart.
The cleanser is one of the best on the market IMO. It's one of those foaming cleaners that are very effective in removing caked on sunscreen, while it does not dry the skin out at all. In fact, it feels as if I already moisturized my face after washing. I love this cleanser, I have a giant container of it in my skincare stash.
Another product I adore is the green SPF containing redness reliever. It's a thick dense cream. A tiny drop needs to be rubbed into the skin, and it completely blocks all redness on my skin. The cream looks green but it blends into the skin and turns my skin color but without the red tone. Less is more here. Don't rely on this product for SPF alone! Use a sunscreen underneath, then dab this green cream on top then might use foundation if you wear it, or nothing else. Your skin will look radiant but not irritated anymore. Dr Jart has this green tinted product in a dropper form in this line and I love that too.
Then there's a moisturizer, that feels nice and nourishing but not overly greasy, so it could be worn day or night.
And finally there's a full size sheet mask to pamper yourself. The sheet mask has a ton of serum, I ended up rubbing it all over my neck, chest, arms and belly. Or you can save the pouch and use the remaining serum the next day. It feels cooling and very moisturizing.
I highly recommend this skincare kit from Dr Jart."

I have always had redness in my T-zone and regardless of what skincare products I have tried in the past, nothing as worked as well as the Derma Green Solution in this set! I was blown away by the difference in my skin tone upon the very 1st application and it instantly became my daily go-to product - my entire complexion completely transformed, and my skintone finally looks even!!! I am in my mid 40s and after wearing heavy makeup to camouflage my redness for the majority of my life, I have been to a point over the last year or so where I much prefer to wear a good moisturizer and sunscreen versus foundation, but I never could bring myself to feel entirely confident without foundation until now! The other products in this set are great, too (the soothing cream is my 2nd favorite!!) and I haven't experienced any sensitivity or reaction upon using them daily.

Box comes packaged nicely, with a plastic seal you have to break to get inside. There's a clear expiration date like on all respectable Korean products.

This is supposed to work for red or irritated skin, but I got it for my teen who struggles with acne, and does have some red spots here and there.

Plus, it was a premium price tag, so must be a premium product, right? Well, not always...
The gel cleanser only works ok, and REALLY stings if you get it in your eyes.
The moisturizer is also ok, but I seem to need much more of it than other moisturizers to achieve the same results, and it's a tiny, expensive tube so that's kind of a bummer.
And the Tiger Balm, the #1 most touted product, in my opinion, is too heavy and dry, and definitely doesn't leave a natural looking finish, BUT it does fully cover redness. So it's good under a tinted moisturizer + bronzer (I've been avoiding blush to also help minimize the look of redness and find bronzer to work very well on its own), but definitely not a product for ""no makeup"" days. And honestly, I like my Cover Girl color correcting primer much better, and it's a fraction of the price.
Only REALLY good thing about this tester pack is that I got to try each product without having to fork over the full price of each full sized product. So if you're dealing with redness, I say THIS pack IS the way to try these products, and who knows, maybe they'll work much better for you. They just aren't my favorite, though I do intend to investigate more cira products from other brands.
Note: I have fair, combination skin with light freckles, especially in the summer. And in my opinion, this product would work best for those with oily skin. I would not recommend it at all for those with dry skin."

Summary - great if you have sensitive, reactive, eczema/rosacea skin, well known brand with cica aka. 'tiger grass' a superstar in sensitive skincare, quality sealed products that will last a long time!

I am the perfect person to test this - I have adult acne, and although my skin never used to be sensitive, it was always red and in the past year, has become reactive to a lot of things - I had a big allergic reaction a week ago and my skin is left dry/oily/texturized/and red. In my photo I show my skin before- mostly healed but still sensitive. Then after the wash -

Everything is sealed with a little tab to pull off, so it's fresh!
The wash - foams nicely, almost no scent but a sliiiiiight metallic tone if I had to pick? Felt nice, removed my thick nightly lotion from the night before and didn't feel tight afterward.
The cream - a slight green hue but goes on invisibly. I thought I felt a slight tingle but it could just be my skin is so sensitive, even gently applying cream tingles. It didn't sting and it dried invisible, not greasy, not overly matte. Felt nice. Put it in my elbow crease too and no reactions there.
The color correcting cream - I already have a full size of this and it is literally over a year old and I""m not even half way though- so this size I would actually prefer to keep it fresh! and it is great depending on your skin. It's a mineral sunscreen so there is an obvious white cast depending on how much you apply. I took this to Japan in the spring when it was cooler than Im' used to, and my dried out skin did show horrible flakes and dryness, although the cream felt really nice. If I apply this thick, it's almost like full coverage foundation, and it will stay 'dewy' if that's your thing - but I find it transfers and feels sticky unless I set it with powder, which does emphasize dry flakes. HOWEVER if you use just a bit, like sunscreen, it fades into my skin invisibly with just a hint of coverage over my red patches. Just depends on how red you are, and how much coverage you want. It has never broken me out.

Overall, the sizes of these items are a bit more than say a free trial size, this would be perfect for a vacation of 2 weeks - a month in my opinion. If you have sensitive skin, you may have heard about the start ingredient here 'tiger grass' aka Cica which is all the rage in sensitive skincare. I highly recommend this kit if you're curious about Dr. Jart and if you have redness especially rosacea or eczema like me. I wish the cost was cheaper, but honestly this set will late you quite a long time!"

I don't normally have redness but I like the idea of this serum balancing moisture levels and repairing the skin barrier.

I didn't feel any stinging and it was not irritating to my skin in any way. I do have dry and sensitive skin so I am always waiting to see if this will make my skin agro but it didn't.

Because of the tiny pin-point shape of the opening, the product is dispensed directly into palm of the hand and gently patted onto the face. No need for a cotton ball which IMO wastes product.

Based on the ingredient list this seems like a super hyaluronic acid serum (an ingredient list which I do not appreciate is not presented on the product page. I included a picture of it). It's got a few extra ingredients that help with balancing and absorption and skin repair. However, I am not entirely convinced of its value. I could go with a good hyaluronic acid serum (with arguably cleaner simpler ingredients) for quite a bit less. Yes, I know, there is a difference between sodium hyaluronate and hyaluronic acid. And, yes, one could argue that sodium hyaluronate has its benefits over hyaluronic acid. Not to mention the other active ingredients this has. Plus, a little goes a long way with this product.

It is a bouncy, gel-like cream which is an opaque faint beige color and fragrance free. The jar seems airtight to keep it from drying out, and you can use the spatula to keep the cream free from bacteria. You only need a small amount to get the coverage needed. It doesn’t feel greasy, but does take a minute or two to absorb. Once absorbed, my skin felt really hydrated, soft and a little moist like there was a barrier on my skin that would help maintain the hydration. I also put some on my elbows since I have noticed dryness there, and it did help soften that area and helped it retain moisture. I think this is worth it if you need it for dry skin or live in dry climates."

I've been using high-end skin care for the last 20 years, and I'm honestly so impressed by this product! Using this right before bed is the best possible treatment and repair for my face and neck (which do tend to get dry overnight). Not only is my skin still fully hydrated the next morning, but it's been that way, without re-application, for the last day and a half. Even after washing, my face felt still softer and my skin more supple than usual. This cream is thick, with an almost paste-like consistency, but warms in your hand and absorbs very well. There's a very light scent, which I don't mind. But, the hydration just can't be beat. I'm debating purchasing the hand cream as my hands are probably the next driest part of my body, but if this was made in an economical body lotion formula, I would consider getting it as well. The biggest downside to this product is the cost- while it doesan amazing job, it is expensive. That would be the only downside. Products is expensive are really not in my budget, but I may try to find a way to keep using this and try the hand cream. I had never tried Dr. Jart products before, but I am a convert.

I peel my skin almost every week because this is how tretinoin works, so it makes my skin irritated and sensitive. This cream from Dr Jart is a must have repair tool. It's a very thick balm-like cream that's deeply nourishing and cushioning. I highly recommend using the toner that comes in this skincare line -rectangular white bottle with a yellow top. Dr Jart has many different skincare lines, but stick with the repair line if your skin is sensitive and has a poor barrier. I apply the repair toner first then this cream. The cream is so thick like a lip balm, you'll need to use a spatula that comes in the box. The cream warms up on my skin and rubs in easily. It's not greasy, but it's extremely nourishing. Literally the next morning all redness on my cheeks that I get after peel is completely gone and my skin has it's natural barrier back. This cream is better used for nighttime treatments, it might be too heavy for daytime. It's very moisturizing, nourishing and skin softening. No scent noted, which is a huge plus too.

This gel-based moisturizer is designed to soothe irritation and provide a cooling sensation, which can be particularly refreshing in hot weather or after a long day.

Key ingredients include Centella Asiatica (also known as Cica or Tiger Grass), known for its healing and anti-inflammatory properties. This makes the moisturizer especially beneficial for calming red, irritated skin. The lightweight, gel texture absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky residue, making it suitable for layering under makeup or using as a soothing treatment before bed.

One of the most appreciated aspects of this moisturizer is its ability to deliver hydration without feeling heavy or clogging pores, making it a good option for combination and oily skin types. The cooling effect is mild but noticeable, offering a pleasant, refreshing feel upon application.

The product is fragrance-free, which is a plus for those with sensitive skin who often find fragranced products irritating. The packaging is also convenient, with a hygienic pump dispenser that ensures you use the right amount without contamination.

Overall, Dr.Jart+ Cicapair Cooling Gel Face Moisturizer is an excellent choice for anyone dealing with redness, irritation, or sensitivity. It provides effective hydration, soothes the skin, and leaves it feeling cool and refreshed. While it may be on the pricier side, the quality and results make it a worthwhile investment for those with sensitive skin concerns."

Some days my goal is to go full out on the moisturization to please the more mature side of my complexion. Other days I need to concentrate on sopping up oils and treating problematic concerns. Of course, those are the extremes. Mostly I'm good adding a little moisturization, as well as making sure my pores are nice and clear. This moisturizing gel cream is ideal for me. It adds a little bit of moisturization while also making sure that any problematic issues are kept under control. It's cool and soothing and absorbs well. Very clean and safer for those who need a gentler moisturizer. Lightweight and protective. Sometimes I use this over all of my face, while other times I'll use it for spot work on my nose and other oilier parts. This is a safe one for my concerns.

An excellent moisturize cream for those looking for a lightweight and extra clean moisturizer that will help ease problematic areas without causing issues. Especially good for combination skin. It's soothing and helpful. Great for those on the oilier side of the ph spectrum. Just as good for men as it is for women. Good for al adult age groups, from teens to seniors."

A small amount covers a large area and it genuinely cools and calms my skin, which is always so problematic during the summer.

The current listed price of $49.40 for 1.69 ounces is more than I'd typically pay for facial cream, but it works so well that I might just get it again anyway."

I've been using this line for years and am always excited when something new is added to the lineup. Unlike the plain moisturizer, this gel cream is lightweight, cooling, and quick absorbing. The cica moisturizer (in the tube) is better for cooler/colder weather and provides some extra oomph for dry skin. And unlike the color correcting moisturizer, this one doesn't really do much to hide or coverup the redness. The light green tint to this gel offers almost zero redness correction. It's more of a skin calming product that helps alleviate the underlying cause of the redness, like rosacea, sun exposure, chapped skin, etc. It is fantastic at helping to calm skin down if you've gone a little gung-ho with exfoliation or masks. This is one of those skincare products you want to keep in the fridge as it feels absolutely amazing on irritated skin. For those with really dry skin, this might not be enough moisturizer on its own. When paired with something like HA serum, as long as you wait for the serum to fully absorb before applying this gel moisturizer it won't pill up while applying. It's also lightweight enough that you can use a heavier moisturizer over the top, especially at night. Does well under makeup primers as long as you give it time to absorb so that your skin is dry before applying the primer. Aside from helping calm skin and providing moisture, this gel isn't an anti-aging product. But with its skin calming properties, it does pair very well with products with retinol or retinoids which can cause redness, drying, and flaking. The Dr. Jart Cica line is one of the two redness lines (the other is La Roche Posey) that actually works with my rosacea and makes a visible difference."

As a cream, it feels really soothing and cooling. Would probably be wonderful after being out in the sun. It’s a nice texture, like a gel-y cream.

They missed the mark on the packaging though. The metal cap is annoying to use and scratches every time I open it.

Overall this is a nice feeling cream and I’ll look forward to continue using it, but it didn’t work for me for its advertised purpose (despite my not being sure that ANY product can for this chin of mine), so I can’t give it more than 3 stars."

This Korean skincare brand has crafted a unique gel-based moisturizer that delivers a calming and refreshing sensation to irritated complexions. Here's an honest review of my experience:

Soothing and Calming:
One of the standout features of this moisturizer is its ability to instantly soothe and calm irritated skin. Infused with centella asiatica and aloe vera, this gel provides a cooling sensation that helps reduce redness and inflammation. My skin felt comforted and relieved, especially during periods of sensitivity and reactivity.

Lightweight and Quick-Absorbing:
The gel-based formula is incredibly lightweight and has a refreshing texture. It absorbs quickly into the skin, providing an immediate cooling effect without leaving any greasy or sticky residue. My skin felt hydrated and balanced, with no heavy or oily sensation often associated with traditional creams.

Redness Reduction:
The formula is designed to target redness and inflamed skin, a common concern for sensitive skin types. The combination of centella asiatica and aloe vera works synergistically to alleviate redness, providing a more even and calm complexion. Over time, I noticed a visible improvement in the overall appearance of my skin's redness.

Suitable for Sensitive Skin:
As a K-beauty enthusiast with sensitive skin, I appreciate that this moisturizer is carefully formulated to be gentle and non-irritating. Free from potential irritants like parabens and fragrances, it ensures a safe and soothing experience for even the most delicate complexions.

Overall Complexion Enhancement:
Not only does this moisturizer address redness, but it also enhances the overall appearance of the skin. My skin looked healthier and more radiant, with a noticeable improvement in texture and tone. It provided a beautiful canvas for makeup application, creating a smooth and even base.

Overall Recommendation:
As a K-beauty enthusiast, I highly recommend the Dr.Jart+ Cicapair Cooling Gel to anyone seeking a soothing and refreshing solution for sensitive and irritated skin. The gel-based formula delivers instant calming relief, reduces redness, and enhances the overall complexion. It's a must-have in your skincare arsenal if you're looking for a gentle and effective moisturizer."

After all, my regular brand offers three masks for the same price and I can feel the moisturizing effects after I use one of them. Sadly, in comparison, I saw no improvement after I removed this mask and the serum sank into my skin. If anything, my skin felt drier and tighter than it did before I used the mask. I had some light flaking on my cheeks and around my nose so something in the mask had a drying effect on my sensitive skin. I took a star because it's on the pricey side and I took another star for the drying effect so 3 stars."

Face masks need to be used as an enhancement with your regular skin care line and can be used weekly, or even daily, depending on what your needs are. Face masks are designed to offer more product on your face for a longer period of time so you can get it deeper into your skin. Your skin cells turn over one every 28 days or so, so in reality you need to try something for 28 days before you can see a difference. That being said, I was very happy with how noticeably shinier and moisturized my skin looked after this! It is a bit expensive, but the ceramidin is a great ingredient that gets deep moisture into your skin. I recommend it, and will be buying it again!"

Since there are no ingredients listed here, this was a long shot but I was glad to receive the product and not see any ingredient that was particularly alarming (don't need the Yellow N5, tho!).

I do find it suspicious when brands do not list their ingredients and wish they would do so for all of their products. It's like, what are you trying to hide? So I've included a picture of the ingredient list.

The mask does have a floral scent, which is from geranium oil, but I did not find it overpowering and I am allergic to fragrance.

It is pretty goopy and the the mask is a bit tricky to unpack. My face may be on the small side but I still felt like some areas weren't covered with this and it didn't fit on great over the eyes. I know you can rip it apart on the nose but I always hate to do that because I like to get as much coverage as possible!

Someone said there was enough in there to apply it a second day. I definitely didn't feel there was enough in the pouch to coat the mask a second time but there was definitely extra cream that can be scooped out and applied elsewhere (or I guess saved for another day but it would likely dry out).

It was moisturizing, though, and was a nice treat for my face. At this price point, it isn't something I would do regularly."

I was not disappointed. I live in a very dry climate and winter especially can do a number on my hands because of the weather and I wash my hands all the time. I go through hand cream like crazy- especially in winter.

I will say that I'm not a fan of most hand creams. In fact, my go to isn't a dedicated hand cream at all. I have a few requirements when it comes to hand creams: non-greasy, quick absorbing, and actually works on dry (potentially scaly) skin. This Dr. Jart does all of that. It also has a very pleasant but very light fragrance to it- almost like a super light citrus.

Initially I thought that the price point was a bit high for a hand cream. However, there is a LOT of product in the tube. It's about the size of a normal size of toothpaste and dispenses similarly. While the tube is large, it still is slim enough to easily tuck into a bag or a purse. I do wish it had a flip cap instead but really not a big deal.

Here’s a detailed review based on its features, performance, and overall value.

**Packaging & Presentation:**
The eye cream comes in a sleek, easy-to-use tube that allows for precise application. The packaging is hygienic and travel-friendly, which is a plus for those who need an on-the-go skincare solution. The design is simple yet effective, with a minimalistic aesthetic that reflects the brand’s clinical approach.

**Formula & Ingredients:**
The cream is powered by Dr.Jart+’s signature Ceramidin Complex, which is rich in ceramides—a crucial component for maintaining the skin’s moisture barrier. This formula is designed to deeply hydrate the skin, helping to strengthen and repair the delicate under-eye area. The cream also includes hyaluronic acid, which provides an extra boost of hydration, and niacinamide, known for its brightening and anti-inflammatory properties.

**Application & Texture:**
The texture of the Ceramidin Under Eye Cream is lightweight and smooth, making it easy to apply without dragging the sensitive skin around the eyes. It absorbs quickly, leaving the skin feeling soft and hydrated without any greasy residue. The cream feels soothing upon application and works well under makeup, making it a versatile addition to both morning and evening skincare routines.

**Performance:**
With consistent use, many users notice a reduction in dryness and an improvement in the overall texture of the under-eye area. The cream effectively hydrates, reducing the appearance of fine lines caused by dehydration. While it provides a good level of moisture, the results in terms of dark circles or puffiness might not be as pronounced as some might hope, especially if these issues are more severe or caused by factors other than dryness.

**Pros:**
- **Deeply hydrating:** Rich in ceramides and hyaluronic acid, it effectively moisturizes the under-eye area.
- **Lightweight texture:** Absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue.
- **Soothing formula:** Feels calming and comfortable on the skin.
- **Good under makeup:** Works well as a base for concealer or other eye makeup.
- **Packaging:** Hygienic and convenient for travel.

**Cons:**
- **Limited results on dark circles and puffiness:** While it hydrates well, it may not significantly reduce more pronounced dark circles or puffiness.
- **Price:** On the higher end, which may be a consideration for those on a budget.
- **Subtle results:** For those looking for dramatic improvements in the under-eye area, this might not be the most potent option.

**Verdict:**
The **Dr.Jart+ Ceramidin Under Eye Cream** is a solid choice for those seeking a deeply hydrating and soothing eye cream. It excels in moisturizing and strengthening the delicate skin around the eyes, making it a great option for addressing dryness and fine lines caused by dehydration. However, if you’re looking for a product that targets dark circles or puffiness more aggressively, you might need to pair it with other treatments or look for a more specialized product. Overall, it's a reliable, high-quality eye cream, particularly for those focused on hydration and maintaining the skin's barrier function."

It comes with a pump top dispenser. It gives a small amount of cream with each pump. I like that I didn't need to use a lot of cream. The cream smoothed on easily and absorbed quickly. It didn't pill when I added a moisturizer on top. My skin felt soft and smooth after using it.

It has a thick, silky texture, and a little truly does go a long way. My under-eyes feel hydrated and moisturized all day, and the cream absorbs quickly so it doesn't mess up my makeup.

I love that the pump packaging keeps the product fresh, and that it contains ceramides and niacinamide because they might have long-term benefits for my skin. The scent is light and pleasant, which is a nice bonus.

The only downside is the price. It's a bit on the expensive side, but considering the quality ingredients and how effective it's been for me, I think it's worth it.

Overall, I highly recommend Dr.Jart+ Ceramidin Eye Cream if you're looking for a rich, hydrating eye cream. While I haven't seen a huge difference in fine lines or puffiness yet, my under-eyes are definitely more moisturized, and I appreciate the formula and packaging."

I am one who needs to use eye cream day and night for my mature combination skin.

This Ceramide eye cream goes in with a rich and silky feel.
Absorbing quickly but leaving my eye area feeling nice and moisturized.

The smell (clean and fresh) has me just as addicted as the silky, rich feel.

This is my first time using Dr. Jart and now I know why this brand is so popular.

Impressive ingredients.

I will definitely look into adding the rest of the skin care line into my daily routine.

It does apply to the under eyes very smoothly to where you don't need too much product but that's about where the good ends. It's thick in texture but it doesn't feel as moisturizing as my current eye cream and after about two weeks of using it at night, I didn't noticed any difference in brightening. I did notice I have more milia than before and because of that I stopped for a week, tried it again and sure enough, the milia came back.

The first thing I noticed about this cream is the scent, which is not aloe as described on the listing. No, it's way better than that! I just love how this cream smells, it's a spicy herbal scent that smells vaguely medicinal. To me, the smell alone makes me feel like I'm at a spa.

There is nothing not to like about this eye cream. The list of ingredients reads like a encyclopedia of ingredients that are good for your skin- ceramides, niacinamide, betaine, squalane, mannitol, Allantoin, adenosine, plus a host of plant oils and extracts.

I love putting this cream on, it's thick and silky, and you only need a little. In the mornings I always wake up with puffy eyes but since I started using this cream, not so much anymore. Of course I haven't noticed much else different, but given the host of lovely ingredients in this cream I expect other benefits to become noticeable over time.

At time of this review, this eye cream is selling for $40. Considering how packed full it is of great ingredients, I'm going to say it's definitely worth it."

I've been doing professional grade peels at home for many years and I'm quite seasoned in it. I use all different types of acids of different percentages and focus on different areas including other spots on my body. Anytime I am using these types of products. I am militant about sunscreen since the protective layer on my face is usually removed when I'm doing these products, so it's crucial to stay out of the sun or use strong protection so I don't damage my skin. I learned this the hard way many years ago not knowing what could happen, which I ended up getting tons of sunspots because I was foolish. Anyway, products like this tend to dry my face out so I just intuitively use it and really bump up my moisturizer while it does its thing. I could use this everyday since my skin is so used to this, but I am just going to use it a couple times a week. I've done exfoliating treatments with it and just have used a cotton ball with it. It's a thicker consistency and goes on like a thickened toner. My skin definitely feels cleaner and more refreshed. Anytime I use these types of products it takes my skin 30 days to fully turn over for me to really see the difference even though I may notice immediately. That's when people usually start asking what I've been doing with my face after the 30-day mark. Overall, I'm happy with this and will keep using it, thank you."

I use a little on a cotton swab/pad, and glide it over my face-making sure my skin is gently cleansed first. I've noticed that just within a few days I've noticed a difference in the appearance (and feel) of my skin. I really like how this works, and didn't cause me any irritation or anything.
There is a light scent (in my opinion), but I don't think it's overpowering. Some people with scent sensitivity may have an issue (and I do have some scent sensitivity); however, I did not experience any issues from this. Everyone is different; though, I find this to be both effective and gentle.❤️

Not only does it make my skin softer, but it’s also gentle, There is no burning or irritation. I incorporate it once a week after washing my face, right before my moisturizing routine. As part of my skin cycling regimen, I exfoliate with this product at night, follow up with a retinol product the next day, and then rest my skin, focusing solely on moisturizers. This approach prevents overloading my skin with too many active ingredients and maintains my moisture barrier. Overall, my skin looks smoother and brighter."

But it also has fragrance. I know some people can have irritation from fragrances so this could cause a problem for them. I did not experience any issues or irritation.

This pore remedy comes with its promise of brighter, smoother skin thanks to a multi-acid complex was very intriguing.

The packaging is sleek and the product itself is a clear liquid with a very faint scent. It comes with a handy pump dispenser, which makes it easy to dispense a controlled amount onto a cotton pad. This isn't a harsh scrub by any means. It has a gentle tingling sensation that lets you know it's working, but it's not irritating at all. The key with this product is consistency. It took about three weeks for me to really notice a difference in my skin texture and overall radiance. My pores appear a bit more refined, and my skin definitely looks brighter and smoother.

I recommend doing a patch test first, especially if you have sensitive skin. And because it has AHA/BHA acids, make sure to wear sunscreen every day, rain or shine! It's easy to use, not irritating, and delivers noticeable results with consistent use."

Pros:
-Non Sticky and liquid consistency allows us to be absorbed very quickly. When dried, it doesn't feel sticky or any type of residue.
-Lightly scented
-No irritation, tingling etc when using or the day after.

You do have to shake this up really well before using, I didn't at first and noticed that the product looked very separated and odd looking until I shook it up. It has a very milky toner looking texture and is also very light. I haven't used a milky exfoliate and I much prefer this format since it sinks in quickly and doesn't feel drying on the skin. It is very strong and potent and irritates my sensitive skin if I use it more than once in a week, so I've been keeping it as a once a week treatment, but if you're more resilient you can use this 2 - 3x a week. I've yet to see much visual difference but it does leave my skin very smooth and soft."

I decided to order this because of the built-in sunscreen. I ordered the light to medium shade, which I was hoping would work because usually medium is too dark for me and light is way too light for me. This shade covers well, although I probably wouldn't be able to use it outside of the summertime because it is slightly too dark for my comfort. It doesn't look bad right now because I have the grass cutting tan on my face :-)

You only need a very small amount of this. I use less than a pea size and that covers my whole face and over my chin line. There was a little bit of learning curve for me because I found that if I put this on without a moisturizer it just did not look natural. If I used my regular moisturizer and then this you could see every pore on my face. I used a lightweight face serum, let it soak into my skin for a few minutes and then put this on top of it. It gave me the perfect look that I wanted!

The texture of this feels good, and it has a good consistency. There was no discernible smell to me, and I am scent sensitive. If I only use a pea sized amount, this bottle will last a very long time making an excellent value."

I use just a tiny dab of regular concealer on the scar, apply this, and it's just gone.

I don't like wearing greasy sun block on my face so my usual go to solution is just to try and not be in the sun as much as possible. That's not really an option at this time of year though, so this stuff is the absolute next best thing for me. I know Vine Voice is supposed to be about helping other customers, but, they've made a customer out of me for this product as well. I will definitely be recommending it to friends and family going forward oo since it does the work of both sun block, minor concealing and foundation.

Just, as others have said, be aware of the color tint. If you're European descent like me you'll want to go as light as possible and hope for the best!"

in the face. So I want something that will help with the fine lines and wrinkles. I know that those
are a part of life and cannot be prevented; but that there are products that help minimize them.
First I like to say that it seems to be working for me. I use daily and I am liking the results. I did
have a few wrinkles, mainly on the forehead and I am happy to say I no longer notice them. So
I am very happy about that. When I look in the mirror all I see is smooth skin. My skin is much
firmer and smoother. No visible signs of fine lines and wrinkles and healthy looking skin. And
since this cream is so easy to use, I use it everyday. It is so nice to have a product that is easy
to use and get the results that I want. I think that the quality of it is great. The color is not
white but like a light gray. Overall I a. happy with it and I think it is a good value for the money."

This Bakuchiol Cream however has been my favorite. First of all, it is very thick upon application. It takes only a small amount to fully cover your face. It makes my face feel SUPER hydrated and coated in an after-shower layer of healing and rejuvenation. These things are hard to review based on effectiveness because its something that takes time and consistent use but I will say that it makes my skin feel great and I look forward to using it every night. The container is larger than necessary because of its aesthetics with a smaller container inside the bright purple container and a large metal lid. Perhaps they are trying to do something like SpoiledChild where you can replace just the smaller container inside and ""reduce waste."" Ideally, this would be a combination of bakuchiol and retinol for a well rounded anti aging cream however I know that some people prefer the natural elements that bakuchiol can provide. If you want a reasonably priced container of bakuchiol that will last you a few months (a little goes a long way) than I believe this is a great option!"

On my skin, it is a small step above pure hyaluronic acid, but it leaves my face somewhat shiny. Since I don't often wear full-face makeup, that shine is very visible.

It's still a good idea to apply sunblock before heading out after using this serum, but at least it won't itch as much. If you can afford it and have sensitive skin, this is a great serum."

I am constantly outside and my legs and arms get a bit of sun of course which prevents me from using retinol for the sides it (may) have with sun exposure. However with Bakuchiol I don't have any sides with sun exposure. So IMO it works great with putting a very small amount of this product in my daily lotion with sunscreen to get full body coverage. I really like the glycerin in this which makes it IMO help to increase the smooth glide of my application of it on my skin. Plus it (glycerin) may help with hydration and as a possible skin barrier preventing moisture loss. Bakuchiol like retinol is thought to help with increasing collagen production. After our 20's we make less of that and it just keeps decreasing supposedly. So at my age I like a skin care product like this and hopefully with my powdered collagen I take daily, this product added to my regimen will help in possibly more collagen being restored. So no doubt this takes my skin care up a level and I am excited to see any results I may get. This did not have any smell and appears top quality in every way. Good Luck and I Hope this was Helpful."

This product is no exception. Bakuchiol is a fairly new ingredient in the skincare world, and it's definitely a ""marathon"" ingredient, not a ""sprint"" ingredient (eg, you're not going to see results overnight, it needs consistent use over time to produce lasting effects). Therefore, I can't really speak to the bakuchiol's presence in this serum or its effects, since I haven't had the serum that long. What I can speak to, however, is the serum's efficacy in other areas. It is incredibly moisturizing, and can honestly act as a one-step routine since it's so hydrating and you don't necessarily need to follow it up with a moisturizer. My skin instantly feels refreshed and plump after applying it. It's really lightweight and gentle, which is amazing on my sensitive skin. Overall, I'm really enjoying using this product and can't wait to reap the long term benefits as I continue to use it."

But it feels and looks like pretty much every other balm/gloss I've used.

The thing that got me, though, was the subtle realization that after applying it during the day my lips don't end up drier or flakier and I don't need to reapply it a ton of times during the day. When I used it at night, I noticed my lips stayed moisturized well into the next morning without needing another application. And the longer I use it, the better my lips feel.

Ease of application:
It arrived and has stayed in a semi-solid state... it doesn't really look like the product images but it doesn't affect the application. It's still very easy to swab with your finger or a lip applicator.

No sticky or tacky feel:
One thing I tend to hate about lip products like these is the gross tacky feel they leave behind. This lip mask doesn't do that!
It feels like a cross between vaseline and chapstick when being applied but quickly absorbs into your lips, so you're only left with a hydrated/dewy feel.

Plumping:
I have somewhat thin lips that seem to retreat into themselves even more when they're dry. This lip mask helps plump them to a healthy level, without making you look like you were stung by a bee.

It's the first I've used where you activate the packet to soak the mask and then apply it. There are two compartments in the mask packet. On one side is the dry mask and on the other is the ""essence"" or liquid. You push the liquid to the dry side, massage it a bit, and then let the mask soak. This is an interesting mechanism that feels a bit more DIY than simply ripping open a package and unfolding a soaked mask. I like it!

One thing I don't like about the mask is the inclusion of YELLOW 5 (CI 19140) in the dry sheet and the inclusion of fragrance in the wet ingredients. The coloring added to the mask feels very unnecessary. It's just there to tint the dry sheet with a citrus design. The fragrance is not unpleasant, but I tend to choose beauty products without added artificial colors and fragrances whenever possible."

So as I opened this I could tell this was thick high quality eye cream. I have occasionally used Ahava Extreme Firming Eye cream in the past and my wife uses it daily (retail $69.00 for .5 oz). So I decided to try Dr. jart+ cream and have been using this eye cream for about 10 days now. I think the results are similar to Ahava. I did no use the whole system just wash my face and apply the eye cream twice a day. I did not use the Serum toner nor Moisturizer. It’s super thick and creamy but absorbs in a few minutes but a leaves a nice protective barrier. It does have a slightly waxier feel after it is absorbed as compared to Ahava. You are supposed to dab an appropriate amount all around the eye area as needed. Pat until fully absorbed

Pros: Quality of the formulation. You can just tell the thickness of the cream. The way is goes on and absorbs so quickly.

Scent: I don’t like things with strong scents on my face and this perfect there barely any smell.

Nonreactive: a couple times I got carried away and put too much on and I never reacted, broke out or has any kind of adverse skin reaction.

Goes along way: This stuff is super concentrated like other high end eye creams so you only need a little.

Cons: It’s not cheap but its right in the range of high end firming eye creams. Maybe even on the value end of similar eye creams

Slightly waxier than Ahava. Once is fully absorbed it leaves a protective barrier and feels a little waxy when compared to the Ahava. But it's was likely intended to protect and keep moisture in. I did not see it nor notice it unless I rubbed my finger and was an ever so subtle difference between the two brands.

Conclusions: I was impressed and it compares well against Ahava extreme eye cream. Photos are from a 50+ person before and 10 days after. My wife use eye cream consistently and also like the product but honestly she likes what she uses and going to stick with it. I may add this to my long term routine. But If your already a regular eye cream user I am confident that this a quality product and works as well as other high end eye creams."

I’ve never found one that just wows me. As I’m approaching my 30s and have naturally tired-looking eyes, I’ve put more of an emphasis on skincare and eye care. I was previously using the LilyAna Naturals eye cream, which was pretty good, but didn’t seem to be doing much more than moisturizing my under eye. When I got this product, I was worried that it’d be too heavy for daytime wear under makeup since it’s more of a thick-looking cream, but I was shocked at how well it absorbs. You need the smallest dab of product, like literally just touching the surface of the cream is plenty, you don’t need even a “pea sized” amount. This product spreads across the skin beautifully, and absorbs quickly. I’ve been using it for a week, and I genuinely feel like I look more awake.

- The cream itself is quite thick and thus a little goes a long way.
- I have noticed an improvement in my under-eye skin where I apply it. This is the most important thing to me.
- It doesn't irritate my skin, and I have typically sensitive hybrid skin.

Cons:
- The jar is a rectangular prism, so it's hard to get all the moisturizer out.
- It's fairly small for the price.
- Since it's so thick, it's difficult to extract just a small amount on your finger.

It is a very small container, .5 ounces, but given that it is more of a putty than a cream a little bit goes a long way. It doesn't leave any residue and dries pretty quickly so it doesn't look like you put anything under your eyes. There is a slight acidic or tingling feeling immediately after applying it which goes away in about 30 seconds. As far as how well it functions, I do notice a difference in how soft the skin is where I applied it, but it will take a while of constant use for a discernible difference in under eye bags. I do think this is in the right range for the quality of the product, I especially like that there is no greasy feeling after use and it fully absorbs so it doesn't look like I used anything."
